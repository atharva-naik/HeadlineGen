"a a 36 year old woman was arrested on monday february 1 for allegedly preventing her children from attending school on the grounds that education is demonic.
police arrested esther njeri  a mother of two from nanyuki  for taking her children out of school for fragile reasons.
esther holds two degrees  one in commerce and another in accounting.
she allegedly banned her two children  a 13 year old girl in class 2 and an 8 year old boy in primary school from going to school.
police car digital citizen  neighbors reported that she warned her friends and family that the world was about to end abruptly  and asked her to repent of their sins and seek salvation.
the chef de secteur discovered that esther’s children had failed to show up at school following an operation to find the schoolchildren who were still being held at home.
esther who equated her journey of salvation to that of the bible shadrach  meshach and abednego  said she was ready to face the law.
principal education secretary belio kipsang issued a circular earlier in the year ordering security officials to locate children held at home after schools reopened when students failed to show up at school.
heads of schools have also been ordered to submit attendance registers to sub county education directors.
there have been a number of reported cases of parents preventing their children from attending school and this is an issue the ministry is addressing.

"the proposal to increase customs duty on certain imported automotive parts in the union budget 2020 21 will lead to increase in car prices  according to merecedes benz india and skoda auto volkswagen  even as component makers said the step will encourage local manufacturing of such items.
the government on monday proposed an increase in customs duty on certain imported components used in automobiles.
in the budget 2021 22  finance minister nirmala sitharaman proposed increase in customs duty of various parts  including ignition wiring sets  safety glass and parts of signalling equipment to 15 per cent with effect from february 2.
the parts would also attract agriculture infrastructure and development cess at the rate of five per cent.
currently  the parts attract customs duty in the range of 7.
5 10 per cent.
the increase in the rise in auto component duties is unexpected in such a revival period  and it will increase the production cost  leading to higher cost for consumers   mercedes benz india managing director and ceo martin schwenk said in a statement.
besides  there could have been further push towards e mobility by lowering import duties on electric vehicles  he added.
similarly  skoda auto volkswagen india managing director gurpratap boparai said the increase in customs duty on certain auto parts to 15 per cent will further increase input costs and prices for cars which depend on specialised components which cannot be manufactured locally due to unviable volumes.
it is important to keep in mind that even in the coming financial year  the passenger vehicle market is unlikely to reach the level of 2018 and the much required rationalisation of gst and cess to aid the auto industry was missing  he added.
both schwenk and boparai however welcomed the announcement of scrappage policy.
the government said the changes in basic customs duty is for creating level playing fields for the benefit of micro  small and medium enterprises  msmes  and other domestic manufacturers.
we are raising custom duty on certain auto parts to 15 per cent to bring them on par with the general rate of auto parts   sitharaman said in her budget speech.
automotive component manufacturers association  acma  president deepak jain said the increase in basic customs duty on select auto components will encourage local manufacturing of such items.
hailing the announcement of the scrappage policy  he noted that the announcements with regards increased spend on road infrastructure  voluntary scrappage policy  research and development and pli among others  augur well for the automotive sector.
hyundai motor india managing director  md  and chief executive officer  ceo  ss kim said the proposed vehicle scrappage policy will provide thrust towards procurement of new automobiles and have a strong positive effect giving a boost to atmanirbhar bharat.
tata motors ceo and md guenter butschek said voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and unfit vehicles  augmenting public transport system in urban areas  continuing focus on adoption of cleaner fuels  and enhancing outlays for developing road infrastructure are positive steps for the auto industry.
toyota kirloskar motor  tkm  vice chairman vikram kirloskar said the long awaited scrapping policy could contribute to lower fuel consumption  lessen pollution while also generating additional demand for cleaner new vehicles.
the auto sector welcomes this announcement and is hopeful that for realising full benefits there will be an early and full implementation of this policy   he added.
similarly  honda cars india senior vice president   director  marketing and sales  rajesh goel said the scrappage policy was one of the long awaited announcements for the auto sector.
expressing similar views  renault india operations country ceo and managing director venkatram mamillapalle said the policy will significantly reduce pollution and should help bolster demand for new vehicles in the commercial and passenger vehicle sectors.
mahindra   mahindra md and ceo pawan goenka said   though details are not yet out  when the policy comes out  it should have full incentive for scrapping and not just disincentive for not scrapping.
apollo tyres chairman onkar s kanwar also said the voluntary vehicle scrappage policy will provide the much needed fillip to the auto and tyre industry.
sitharaman on monday announced the much awaited voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and polluting vehicles.
presenting the budget for 2021 22 in parliament  sitharaman said that under voluntary vehicle scrapping policy  personal vehicles would undergo fitness tests after 20 years while commercial vehicles would require it after completion of 15 years.
road transport  highways and msmes minister nitin gadkari said the policy will lead to new investment of around rs 10 000 crore and create as many as 50 000 jobs.

"boston  following months of interdisciplinary research assessing tens of thousands of lung cells infected with the novel coronavirus  scientists have created one of the most comprehensive maps to date of the molecular activities that are triggered inside these cells at the onset of the viral infection  an advance that may lead to the development of new drugs to combat covid 19.
from their analysis  the scientists  including those from boston university in the u.
s.
discovered close to 18 existing drugs approved by the u.
s.
food and drug administration  fda  that could potentially be repurposed to combat covid 19 soon after a person becomes infected.
they said five of these drugs could reduce the spread of the coronavirus in human lung cells by more than 90.
in the research  published in the journal molecular cell  the scientists simultaneously infected tens of thousands of lab grown human lung cells with the sars cov 2 virus  and tracked what happens in these cells during the moments after infection.
they said these engineered cells are not completely identical to the living  breathing cells inside our bodies  but are the  closest thing to it.
what makes this research unusual is that we looked at very early time points  of infection   at just one hour after the virus infects lung cells.
it was scary to see that the virus already starts to damage the cells so early during infection   said study co author and virologist elke muhlberger from boston university  bu.
according to the researchers   the virus does wholesale remodeling of the lung cells.
it s amazing the degree to which the virus commandeers the cells it infects   said andrew emili  another co author of the study from bu.
since viruses cannot replicate themselves  they hijack the host cell machinery to make copies of its genetic material.
in the study  the scientists found that when sars cov 2 takes over  it completely changes the cells  metabolic processes.
the virus even damages the cells  nuclear membranes within three to six hours after infection  which the team said was very surprising.
in contrast   cells infected with the deadly ebola virus don t show any obvious structural changes at these early time points of infection  and even at late stages of infection  the nuclear membrane is still intact   muhlberger said.
the scientists explained that the cell s nuclear membrane surrounds the nucleus  which holds the majority of the genetic information  and controls and regulates normal cellular functions.
with the nucleus compromised by the coronavirus  they said  things rapidly take a bad turn for the entire cell.
the lung cells — which normally play a role in maintaining the essential gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide that occurs when we breathe —die under this siege  the study noted.
according to the researchers  the cells also emit distress signals which boost inflammation as they die  triggering a cascade of biological activity that accelerates more cell death.
this eventually leads to pneumonia  acute respiratory distress  and lung failure  they explained.
i couldn t have predicted a lot of these pathways  most of them were news to me.
that s why our  experimental  model is so valuable   said andrew wilson  one of the study s senior authors.

"कोरोना वायरस  ‘मैं जब सोती हूँ  मेरा फ़ोन कोविड 19 पर रिसर्च करता है’  जो टाइडी  साइबर रिपोर्टर  बीबीसी न्यूज़  इमेज स्रोत  adam kuylenstierna / eyeem  रात में हैना लॉसन वेस्ट का रूटीन सभी सामान्य जीवन जीने वाले लोगों की तरह होता है.
वे क़रीब साढ़े दस बजे सोने की तैयारी करती हैं.
बिस्तर में जाने से पहले ब्रश करना  इस बीच अपने इलेक्ट्रिक बेड को गर्म होने के लिए छोड़ देना और मुँह धोकर सोने के लिए जाना.
सोने से पहले हैना कुछ ख़बरिया साइट्स देखती हैं.
अपना इंस्टाग्राम चेक करती हैं और फिर फ़ोन को चार्जिंग पर लगाकर सो जाती हैं.
इसके बाद  जब 31 वर्षीय हैना अपने लंदन स्थित घर में सो रही होती हैं  तो क़रीब आठ घंटे तक उनका फ़ोन एक अलग ड्यूटी पर होता है.
वो कुछ वैज्ञानिकों को अपनी पावर इस्तेमाल करने देता है  ताकि कोरोना वायरस से जुड़ी रिसर्च में उनकी मदद हो सके.
उनका फ़ोन बीते 11 महीने से इस रिसर्च में शामिल है और वैज्ञानिकों के लिए क़रीब 25 000 कैलकुलेशन कर चुका है.
हैना  दुनिया के उन क़रीब एक लाख लोगों में शामिल हैं जो निरंतर रूप से ड्रीमलैब ऐप को ‘स्मार्टफ़ोन कम्प्यूटिंग टाइम’ डोनेट करते हैं.
ये ऐप एक रिसर्च के ज़रिये यह पता करने की कोशिश कर रहा है कि किन न्यूट्रिएंट्स की मदद से कोविड 19 के मरीज़ों का फ़ायदा हो सकता है  ख़ासकर उन लोगों का जो लंबे समय तक ‘कोविड 19’ के लक्षणों से ग्रसित रहे.
अब तक इस बात का कोई प्रमाण नहीं है कि किसी किस्म के खाने से कोविड से बचा जा सकता है या कुछ चीज़ें खाने से यह वायरल संक्रमण नहीं होता.
लेकिन इस क्षेत्र में रिसर्च की जा रही है और यह ऐप इसी का पता लगाने की कोशिश कर रहा है.
यह अध्ययन इम्पीरियल कॉलेज लंदन और द वोडाफ़ोन फ़ाउंडेशन चैरिटी द्वारा किया जा रहा है.
कंप्यूटिंग की शक्ति  इसके आयोजकों का कहना है कि जो काम स्मार्टफ़ोन कंप्यूटर नेटवर्क कर रहा है और जिस तेज़ी से कर रहा है  वह सामान्य कंप्यूटर से कर पाना बहुत मुश्किल है और उसमें बहुत ज़्यादा समय लगता है.
बताया गया है कि स्मार्टफ़ोन कंप्यूटर नेटवर्क जिस डेटा को तीन महीने में प्रोसेस कर सकता है  उसे प्रोसेस करने में सामान्य कंप्यूटर को 300 वर्ष लगेंगे.
हैना बताती हैं   इस ऐप के बारे में मुझे सबसे पहले जानकारी तब मिली थी  जब मेरे पिता को ब्लड कैंसर हुआ था.
कैंसर की दवा खोजने वाला प्रोजेक्ट  मेरा पहला प्रोजेक्ट था जिसके लिए मैंने अपने फ़ोन का ‘स्मार्टफ़ोन कम्प्यूटिंग टाइम’ डोनेट किया था.
लेकिन जब कोविड 19 महामारी आयी  तो मैंने प्रोजेक्ट बदलने का निर्णय लिया.
मुझे लगा कि किसी ऐसे प्रोजेक्ट को ‘पावर’ देनी चाहिए जो कोविड 19 से जुड़े सवालों के जवाब दे सके.
हैना हफ़्ते में सिर्फ़ एक या दो बार ही इस ऐप को चेक करती हैं.
वे कहती हैं   अच्छा लगता है  जब पता चलता है कि आपसे जुड़ी कोई चीज़ किसी ख़ास काम में शामिल है  वो भी तब  जब आप सो रहे थे.
सच कहूँ तो मेरे पास बताने के लिए कोई वजह नहीं कि और लोग क्यों इसमें शामिल नहीं होते.
हैना जैसे वॉलेंटियर अब तक पाँच करोड़ से ज़्यादा कैलकुलेशन करने में वैज्ञानिकों की सहायता कर चुके हैं.

हैना के घर से क़रीब 900 मील दूरी पर  लिस्बन स्थित एक घर में एंजलिका एज़ीवेडो का फ़ोन भी ऐसी ही कैलकुलेशन कर रहा है.
जब वे सो रही होती हैं  तो उनका फ़ोन चुपचाप नंबरों का खेल सुलझा रहा होता है.
एंजलिका कहती हैं   मेरी माँ की मृत्यु महामारी के दौरान ल्यूकीमिया से हुई.
शायद यही वजह है कि मैं मेडिकल से संबंधित समस्याओं को लेकर ज़्यादा संवेदनशील हूँ.
मुझे लगता है कि मैं अगर कोविड 19 से लड़ने में किसी भी तरह मदद कर सकूं  तो मुझे उसके लिए प्रयास करना चाहिए.
28 वर्षीय एंजलिका रोज़ सुबह एक बार इस ऐप को देखती हैं.
वे कहती हैं कि इससे उन्हें दिन की एक पॉज़िटिव शुरुआत मिलती है.
बीबीसी से बातचीत में उन्होंने कहा   मैं हर सुबह देखती हूँ कि मेरे फ़ोन ने रात में कितनी कैलकुलेशन कीं.
इससे मुझे अच्छा महसूस होता है.
मुझे लगता है कि मैंने भी किसी तरह अपना योगदान दिया.
वैज्ञानिकों की राय  इम्पीरियल कॉलेज लंदन के फ़ैकल्टी ऑफ़ मेडिसिन के प्रोफ़ेसर किरिल वेसेलकोव का कहना है कि वे उन सभी लोगों के बेहद आभारी हैं जिन्होंने उनके शोध को बढ़ावा देने में मदद की है.
कोरोना ai प्रोजेक्ट केवल 55 प्रतिशत पूरा हुआ है.
लेकिन उनकी यूनिवर्सिटी में लगे सुपर कंप्यूटर भी उतने कैलकुलेशन नहीं कर पाए हैं  जितनी मदद उन्हें लोगों के स्मार्टफ़ोन्स से मिली है.
किरिल के अनुसार  एक लाख स्मार्टफ़ोन  सुपर कंप्यूटरों से क़रीब दो से तीन गुना तेज़ होते हैं.
इमेज कैप्शन  ऐप मुफ़्त है और एक चैरेटी इसे फंड करती है  प्रोफ़ेसर किरिल का रिसर्च पेपर ह्यूमन जीनॉमिक्स नामक जर्नल में छपने वाला है.
इस रिसर्च में वैज्ञानिकों ने इस बात पर ज़ोर दिया है कि क़रीब 50 ऐसे विशिष्ट अणु पाए गए हैं जिनमें सैद्धांतिक रूप से एंटी कोविड गुण हो सकते हैं.
दुनिया भर के कई वैज्ञानिक इस शोध में इसलिए भी दिलचस्पी ले रहे हैं  क्योंकि रिसर्च के लिए लोगों के स्मार्टफ़ोन जोड़ने का जो तरीक़ा इस शोध के लिए अपनाया गया है  वो अलग है.
कुछ वैज्ञानिकों का यह भी कहना है कि अगर खाने की चीज़ों से मिलने वाले विशिष्ट अणुओं की पहचान कर भी ली गई  तो भी महामारी पर ज़्यादा प्रभाव सोशल डिस्टेन्सिंग  हाइजीन और संभावित वैक्सीन का ही होगा.
इस रिसर्च के लिए जो लोग वॉलेंटियर कर रहे हैं और एक ऐप के ज़रिये अपने फ़ोन को ‘वैज्ञानिक कैलकुलेशन’ के लिए समर्पित कर रहे हैं  उसे ‘वॉलेंटियर कंप्यूटिंग’ कहा जाता है जिसकी शुरुआत 1990 के दशक में हुई थी.

revenue deficit grants   the release said that based on uniform norms of assessing revenues and expenditure of the states and the union  15th fc has recommended total revenue deficit grants  rdg  of rs 2 94 514 crore over the award period for seventeen states.
local governments   the report said the total size of the grant to local governments should be rs.
4 36 361 crore for the period 2021 26.
of these total grants  rs 8 000 crore is performance based grants for incubation of new cities and rs 450 crore is for shared municipal services.
a sum of rs 2 36 805 crore is earmarked for rural local bodies  rs 1 21 055 crore for urban local bodies and rs 70 051 crore for health grants through local governments   it said.
the ministry said fc s report categorises urban local bodies into two groups based on population  and different norms have been used for the flow of grants to each  based on their specific needs and aspirations.
basic grants are proposed only for cities/towns having a population of less than a million.
for million plus cities  100 per cent of the grants are performance linked through the million plus cities challenge fund  mcf    it added.
health   15th fc recommended that health spending by states should be increased to more than 8 per cent of their budget by 2022.
given the inter state disparity in the availability of medical doctors  it is essential to constitute an all india medical and health service as is envisaged under section 2a of the all india services act  1951.
the total grants in aid support to the health sector over the award period works out to rs 1 06 606 crore  which is 10.
3 per cent of the total grants in aid recommended by 15th fc.
the grants for the health sector will be unconditional   the ministry said.
15th fc recommended health grants aggregating to rs 70 051 crore for urban health and wellness centres  hwcs   building less sub centre  phcs  chcs  block level public health units  support for diagnostic infrastructure for the primary healthcare activities and conversion of rural sub centres and phcs to hwcs.
these grants will be released to the local governments   it said.
out of the remaining grant of rs 31 755 crore for the health sector  total of rs.
1 06 606 crore minus rs.
70  051 crore through local bodies and rs 4800 crore state specific grants   15th fc has recommended rs.
15 265 crore for critical care hospitals.
this includes rs.
13 367 crore for general states and rs 1 898 crore for neh states.
15th fc also recommended rs.
13 296 crore for training of the allied healthcare workforce.
out of this  rs.
1 986 crore will be for neh states and rs.
11 310 crore for general states.
performance incentives and grants   for performance incentives  15th fc has recommended grants of rs 4 800 crore  rs 1 200 crore each year  from 2022 23 to 2025 26 for incentivising the states to enhance educational outcomes.
15th fc also recommended rs 6 143 crore for online learning and development of professional courses  medical and engineering  in regional languages  matribhasha  for higher education in india.
the report suggested that rs 45 000 crore should be kept as a performance based incentive for all the states for carrying out agricultural reforms  for amending their land related laws on the lines of niti aayog s model law  for incentive based grants to states that maintain and augment groundwater stock  growth in agricultural exports  and production of oilseeds  pulses and wood and wood based products.
defence and internal security  keeping in view the extant strategic requirements for national defence in the global context  15th fc in its approach has re calibrated the relative shares of union and states in gross revenue receipts.
this will enable the union to set aside resources for the special funding mechanism that 15th fc has proposed.
the union government may constitute in the public account of india  a dedicated non lapsable fund  modernisation fund for defence and internal security  mfdis.
the total indicative size of the proposed mfdis over the period 2021 26 is rs.
2 38 354 crore   the ministry said.
disaster risk management   the report said that mitigation funds should be set up at both the national and state levels  in line with the provisions of the disaster management act.
the mitigation fund should be used for those local level and community based interventions which reduce risks and promote environment friendly settlements and livelihood practices   ministry said.
for state disaster risk management fund  sdrmf   15th fc recommended the total corpus of rs 1 60 153 crore for states for disaster management for the duration of 2021 26  of which the union s share is rs.
1 22 601 crore and states  share is rs 37 552 crore.
15th fc also recommended six earmarked allocations for a total amount of rs 11 950 crore for certain priority areas  namely  two under the ndrf  expansion and modernisation of fire services and resettlement of displaced people affected by erosion  and four under the ndmf  catalytic assistance to twelve most drought prone states  managing seismic and landslide risks in the ten hill states  reducing the risk of urban flooding in seven most populous cities and mitigation measures to prevent erosion.
fiscal consolidation  the ministry said the report provided a range for fiscal deficit and debt path of both the union and states.
it recommended additional borrowing room to states based on performance in power sector reforms.
it said a threshold amount of annual appropriation should be fixed below which the funding for a centrally sponsored scheme  ccs  may be stopped.
below the stipulated threshold  the administrating department should justify the need for the continuation of the scheme.
as the life cycle of ongoing schemes has been made co terminus with the cycle of finance commissions  the third party evaluation of all csss should be completed within a stipulated timeframe.
the flow of monitoring information should be regular and should include credible information on output and outcome indicators   ministry said.
in view of the uncertainty that prevails at the stage that 15th fc has done its analysis  as well as the contemporary realities and challenges  we recognise that the frbm act needs a major restructuring and recommend that the time table for defining and achieving debt sustainability may be examined by a high powered inter governmental group.
this high powered group can craft the new frbm framework and oversee its implementation.
it is important that the union and state governments amend their frbm acts  based on the recommendations of the group  so as to ensure that their legislations are consistent with the fiscal sustainability framework put in place.
this high powered inter governmental group could also be tasked to oversee the implementation of the 15th finance commission s diverse recommendations   it added.
the report said state governments may explore the formation of independent public debt management cells which will chart their borrowing programme efficiently.

a new study indicates that diabetes during pregnancy may increase the risk of heart disease.
the study suggests that women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy  gestational diabetes  are twice as likely by mid life to develop calcium in heart arteries    a strong predictor of heart disease    even if healthy blood sugar levels were attained many years after pregnancy.
we were surprised to discover that women with a history of gestational diabetes are at a significantly greater risk of heart artery calcification  even if they maintain normal blood sugar levels after pregnancy   said co author erica p.
gunderson from kaiser permanente in california  us.
for the study  published in circulation  journal of the american heart association  the team enrolled approximately 1 100 women without type 1 or type 2 diabetes who subsequently gave birth at least once during the 25 year study period  which ended in 2011.
blood tests were performed from before to after pregnancies at five year intervals to determine if women had normal blood sugar levels  intermediate elevations in blood sugar levels  pre diabetes  or they had developed overt type 2 diabetes.
heart scans were performed to measure coronary artery calcium  a strong predictor for heart disease  at exams 15  20 and 25 years after the baseline  the first exam of the study.
at the 25 year follow up  the participants  median age was 48 years  and 12 per cent of the women in the study had a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes.
the prospective analysis found that women with a history of gestational diabetes had a two fold higher risk of coronary artery calcification whether they had healthy blood sugar levels  pre diabetes or type 2 diabetes.
of women with previous gestational diabetes  36 per cent developed pre diabetes and 26 per cent developed type 2 diabetes  compared to 35 per cent and 9 per cent of women with no history of gestational diabetes  the researchers said.

"interpace biosciences announces license agreement with rutgers university and mass general hospital  globenewswire2021 02 01  parsippany  nj  feb.
01  2021  globe newswire     interpace biosciences  inc.
nasdaq  idxg  announced today that it has executed a license agreement with rutgers  the state university of new jersey  and massachusetts general hospital for a novel monoclonal antibody platform  das 1  used in the risk assessment of pancreatic cysts.
although some cysts may have no cancerous potential at all  other cysts carry up to a 48 percent chance of harboring invasive cancer  and surgery to remove them is often complex.
therefore  there is a need to develop additional tools to identify which pancreatic cysts may develop into cancer and which ones will not.
in a recent  national multicenter study of patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic cysts  the das 1 antibody was able to accurately identify pancreatic cysts likely to become cancerous with high sensitivity and high specificity in comparison to current clinical guidelines  das  k et al   cross validation of the monoclonal antibody das 1 in identification of high risk mucinous pancreatic cystic lesion    gastroenterology 2019  157 720 730.
das 1 is gaining recognition among experts in the gi community as evidenced by its inclusion as a component in the pancreatic cyst biomarker alliance sponsored in part by the national cancer institute.
the license gives interpace exclusive commercial rights to this patented technology.
the company’s flagship product  pancragen  was designed to provide risk assessment for pancreatic cysts using both molecular and clinical features and has been performed on more than 40 000 pancreatic cysts.
this new biomarker will provide additional information regarding cancer risk to further facilitate personalized patient management.
koushik k.
das  md  an assistant professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology at washington university said   we are thrilled to bring our discoveries from the bench to the bedside with the help of interpace.
utilizing das 1 to identify patients at risk of pancreatic cancer has been our goal for many years.
details of the agreement were not provided.
according to tom burnell  president   ceo of interpace   the agreement with these highly respected institutions represents an important evolution of our gi franchise as we strive to provide the most comprehensive risk assessment tool available for physicians and their patients.
he continued   this is also another indication of our commitment to innovation and expanding our clinical expertise even further.
about pancragen  pancragen is a pancreatic cyst molecular test that  by using a small sample of pancreatic cyst fluid  can aid in pancreatic cancer risk assessments  enabling effective risk stratification of patients.
pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnose in early stages and typically spreads rapidly with signs and symptoms appearing when the cancer is significantly advanced.
because of this  and that complete surgical removal of the pancreas is not possible  pancreatic cancer is considered a leading cause of cancer deaths.
about interpace biosciences  interpace biosciences is a leader in enabling personalized medicine  offering specialized services along the therapeutic value chain from early diagnosis and prognostic planning to targeted therapeutic applications.

"emi  personal loan  home loan लेने वाले ध्‍यान दें  सुप्रीम कोर्ट में लोन मोरेटोरियम पर होन वाली है सुनवाई  emi  personal loan  home loan लेने वालों के लिए फिर से महत्‍वपूर्ण सूचना है कि लोन मोरेटोरियम के मामले में सोमवार को सुप्रीम कोर्ट में सुनवाई का अगला दौर शुरू होने जा रहा है। कोरोना महामारी के मद्देनजर टर्म लोन पर ब्याज की मियाद बढ़ाने और ब्याज पर छूट देने की याचिका पर सुनवाई के दौरान आज भी कई दलीलें पेश की गईं। ब्याज माफी के खिलाफ केंद्र ने सुप्रीम कोर्ट से कहा कि यदि ब्याज सभी प्रकार के ऋणों पर छूट दी जाती है  तो माफ की गई राशि 6 ​​लाख करोड़ रुपये से अधिक होगी  इस कारण ब्याज माफी पर भी विचार नहीं किया गया। यह बैंकों के निवल मूल्य का एक बड़ा हिस्सा मिटा देगा  बैंकों के अस्तित्व के बारे में गंभीर सवाल उठाएगा। अकेले एसबीआई के लिए  ब्याज माफी बैंकों के निवल मूल्य का आधा हिस्सा मिटा देगी। जमाकर्ताओं के लिए निरंतर भुगतान महत्वपूर्ण  प्रत्येक उधारकर्ता के लिए लगभग 8.
5 जमाकर्ता हैं। लोन मोरेटोरियम की अवधि बढ़ाने व ब्याज पर ब्याज में छूट की याचिकाओं पर सुप्रीम कोर्ट में सुनवाई के दौरान केंद्र सरकार ने कहा कि मोरेटोरियम अवधि में सभी लोनधारकों को ब्याज पर ब्याज में छूट देना अव्यावहारिक होता। इस छूट से छह लाख करोड़ रुपये का बोझ पड़ता और बैंकों की नेटवर्थ का अच्छा खासा हिस्सा इसमें चला जाता। कोरोना के कारण आर्थिक चुनौतियों को देखते हुए मार्च से अगस्त के दौरान लोन की किस्तें टालने  लोन मोरेटोरियम  का फैसला किया गया था। केंद्र की ओर से सॉलिसिटर जनरल तुषार मेहता ने जस्टिस अशोक भूषण  आरएस रेड्डी और एमआर शाह की पीठ को बताया कि अर्थव्यवस्था पर पड़ने वाले असर को देखते हुए ही लोगों को किस्त चुकाने से छूट दी गई थी  लेकिन ब्याज पर छूट नहीं दी गई।  supreme court adjourns to december 14  the hearing on the pleas seeking an extension of the loan moratorium period and waiver of interest on interest on term loans in view of the covid 19 pandemic pic.

com/kunknq6vvm — ani   ani  december 9  2020  ब्‍याज पर ब्‍याज से मिली थी छूट  केंद्र सरकार ने दो करोड़ रुपये तक के पर्सनल व एमएसएमई लोन के लिए मोरेटोरियम अवधि में ब्याज पर ब्याज में छूट का एलान किया था। लोन मोरेटोरियम का लाभ नहीं लेने वाले कर्जधारकों को भी साधारण ब्याज एवं चक्रवृद्धि ब्याज के अंतर के बराबर की राशि उनके खाते में दी गई है। कोरोना संकट के मद्देनजर कर्जधारकों को बैंक से लिए दो करोड़ रुपये तक के कर्ज पर 31 अगस्त तक किस्त चुकाने की बाध्यता से राहत दी गई थी। अवधि की समाप्ति के बाद बैंकों द्वारा कर्जधारकों से छूट की अवधि के ब्याज पर ब्याज वसूले के मामले को सुप्रीम कोर्ट देख रहा है।  9 दिसंबर की सुनवाई के मुख्‍य अंश    शीर्ष अदालत covid 19 महामारी के मद्देनजर रियल एस्टेट और बिजली की मांग सहित विभिन्न निकायों की दलीलों की सुनवाई कर रही है।      अगर बैंकों को यह बोझ उठाना पड़ता है  तो यह जरूरी है कि वे अपने निवल मूल्य का एक बड़ा और प्रमुख हिस्सा मिटा दें  अधिकांश उधारदाताओं को अस्वीकार्य और उनके बहुत ही जीवित रहने पर बहुत गंभीर प्रश्नचिह्न खड़ा करते हैं।    सुप्रीम कोर्ट बुधवार को ऋण स्थगन या ब्याज माफी मामले में सुनवाई जारी रखेगा।    जस्टिस अशोक भूषण  आरएस रेड्डी और एमआर शाह की खंडपीठ ने मंगलवार को मामले की सुनवाई की।    केंद्र द्वारा सूचित किया गया कि अगर सभी ऋणों पर ब्याज माफ करने पर विचार करना है और छह महीने की नैतिकता अवधि के लिए उधारकर्ताओं की सभी श्रेणियों को अग्रिम की घोषणा की गई है covid 19 महामारी के मद्देनजर rbi द्वारा  तब राशि की राशि 6 लाख करोड़ रुपये से अधिक होगी।  तुषार मेहता ने यह कहा    मेहता ने कहा कि अब तक बड़े कर्जदारों का संबंध है  आरबीआई ने के वी कामथ की अध्यक्षता में एक विशेषज्ञ समिति नियुक्त की जिसने विभिन्न क्षेत्र के उधारकर्ताओं को 26 श्रेणियों में अलग कर दिया और ऐसे पैरामीटर दिए जिनके भीतर बैंकों को खातों के पुनर्गठन के लिए निर्देशित किया गया था।    मेहता ने कहा कि यद्यपि ऋण लेने वालों का सटीक प्रतिशत देना संभव नहीं हो सकता है  जिन्होंने अधिस्थगन का लाभ नहीं उठाया है और समय पर किश्तें जमा की हैं  लगभग ऐसी कक्षा 50 प्रतिशत से अधिक होगी। मेहता ने कहा कि संकटग्रस्त छोटे कर्जदारों को राहत देते हुए  केंद्र ने फैसला किया कि छह महीने की अधिस्थगन अवधि के दौरान चक्रवृद्धि ब्याज की छूट पर राहत उन उधारकर्ताओं की सबसे कमजोर श्रेणी तक सीमित होगी  जिन्होंने 2 करोड़ रुपये तक का ऋण लिया था। उन्होंने कहा कि आरबीआई ने 6 अगस्त को अपने सर्कुलर में बड़े कर्जदारों  1500 करोड़ रुपये और उससे अधिक के लोन अकाउंट होने और बड़े कर्जदारों के रूप में नहीं  को वर्गीकृत किया।    मेहता ने केंद्र द्वारा छोटे और मध्यम आकार के व्यापार / msmes के लिए सेक्टर विशिष्ट राहत उपायों को भी बताया  जिसमें रेस्तरां और होटल जैसे सेक्टर शामिल हैं। उन्होंने कहा कि केंद्र ने 3 लाख करोड़ रुपये की आपातकालीन क्रेडिट लिंक्ड गारंटी स्कीम  eclgs  को ब्याज दर से कम दर पर अतिरिक्त क्रेडिट प्रदान करने और 100  जमानत नहीं देने का वादा किया है। उन्होंने कहा कि इस योजना को रेस्तरां और होटल क्षेत्रों सहित सत्ताईस covid 19 प्रभावित क्षेत्रों में उच्च वित्तीय सीमाओं के साथ विस्तारित किया गया है।    मेहता ने कहा कि प्रत्येक ऋण खाते के लिए भारतीय बैंकिंग प्रणाली में लगभग 8.
5 जमा खाते हैं और केंद्र सरकार द्वारा पहले से दी गई विभिन्न वित्तीय राहतों पर प्रकाश डाला गया है। उन्होंने कहा कि आगे चलकर समग्र आर्थिक परिदृश्य के लिए हानिकारक हो सकता है  राष्ट्र की अर्थव्यवस्था या बैंकिंग क्षेत्र वित्तीय बाधाओं के परिणामस्वरूप लेने में सक्षम नहीं हो सकता है।    25 सितंबर को इंडियन बैंक्स एसोसिएशन द्वारा दायर हलफनामे का उल्लेख करते हुए  एसजी तुषार मेहता ने कहा कि भारतीय स्टेट बैंक ने कहा है कि छह महीने की मोहलत के दौरान उधारकर्ताओं से मिलने वाली ब्याज राशि 88 078 करोड़ रुपये  लगभग  होगी  जबकि ब्याज देय होगा उक्त अवधि के दौरान जमाकर्ता 75 157 करोड़ रुपये  लगभग  काम करते हैं।  जानिये 8 दिसंबर की सुनवाई की सारी अपडेट    सॉलिसिटर जनरल तुषार मेहता ने शीर्ष अदालत को बताया कि छह महीने की ऋण स्थगन अवधि के दौरान ब्याज की पूरी छूट के साथ एक लागत जुड़ी है।    सॉलिसिटर जनरल ने कहा   अगर हम ब्याज माफ कर देते हैं  तो इससे जुड़ी लागत आ जाती है। या तो बैंक इसे ले लेते हैं या सरकार को। सरकार नहीं कर सकती और जमाकर्ता नहीं कर सकते।     कोई नहीं कह रहा है कुछ नहीं किया गया है। ऐसा नहीं है कि कुछ भी नहीं किया गया है। सबमिशन कुछ और है जो चरण उद्योगों के माध्यम से किए जाने की आवश्यकता है।    आरबीआई द्वारा सर्कुलर जारी किए गए हैं। लेकिन कुछ शर्तें हैं जिनके द्वारा आरबीआई द्वारा दिए गए लाभ को हटा दिया जाता है और बहुमत से लाभ प्राप्त होता है।    भले ही इस साल अगस्त में रिस्ट्रक्चरिंग सर्कुलर सामने आया हो  लेकिन दिक्कतें जारी हैं। इसलिए अधिक उपायों की आवश्यकता है। 31 मार्च का मतलब है कि बहुत से लोगों को बाहर रखा जाएगा।    सॉलिसिटर जनरल तुषार मेहता ने कहा  अभी तक जनता को दी गई राहत की मात्रा और उसके प्रभाव पर प्रभाव देखें। अगर छूट दी जाती है  तो 6 लाख करोड़ का नुकसान होगा। इस प्रकार छूट पर विचार नहीं किया गया था लेकिन केवल किस्तों का भुगतान टाल दिया गया था।    भारतीय बैंकिंग प्रणाली के लिए इस समय  एक ऋणदाता के लिए आठ जमाकर्ता हैं।    6 लाख करोड़ रुपये का ब्याज माफ करना अकल्पनीय है। कई द्वारा गलत तरीके से लागू किए गए मोराटोरियम। यह टालना है  छूट नहीं। लगभग आधे उधारकर्ताओं को यह पता था  और उन्होंने अधिस्थगन का लाभ नहीं उठाया।    किसी ने भी इस तथ्य को स्वीकार नहीं किया कि अधिकांश खर्च सार्वजनिक स्वास्थ्य और व्यय में जाता है। इस तरह की राहत अक्सर प्रत्येक मंत्रालय से देखी जाती है। केंद्र ने जो भी कदम उठाए थे  उठाए हैं।    ndma  नेशनल डिजास्टर मैनेजमेंट अथॉरिटी  ने इस पहलू को व्यक्त किया है कि वित्त मंत्रालय इस पर कॉल कर सकता है या नहीं और वे इस बात पर सहमत हुए हैं कि मंत्रालय कॉल कर सकता है।    मध्यम और निम्न मध्यम वर्ग हितों की माफी चाहता था और अन्य बड़े कॉर्पोरेट दिग्गज हैं जिनके पास विरासत के मुद्दे हैं। उनके पास covid से पहले के मुद्दे थे और कोविद ने शायद अपने मुद्दों को बढ़ा दिया था।  बार और बेंच से इनपुट्स      कामथ समिति में क्रेडाई के सलाहकार थे  जो भी श्री सिब्बल ने यहां दिखाया  वह कामथ समिति को भी दिखाया गया। 3 लाख करोड़ रुपये की आपातकालीन ऋण लिंक योजना शुरू की गई।     2 प्रतिशत ब्याज सबवेंशन स्कीम की घोषणा  रु। 20 000 करोड़ का क्रेडिट ब्याज माफी कभी हल नहीं थी। पुराने डिफॉल्टर्स का covid से कोई लेना देना नहीं है।    ऋण खातों के पुनर्गठन और दी गई राहत को अनुकूलित करके मामला वित्त मंत्रालय या आरबीआई के लिए संभव नहीं है।    अधिकांश याचिकाकर्ता संघों की विरासत के मुद्दे पूर्व covid कारकों के कारण हैं। बिजली क्षेत्र के लिए जो कुछ भी किया जा सकता था  किया गया है।  cnbc tv18 से इनपुट     उधारकर्ताओं को चक्रवृद्धि ब्याज का भुगतान करना पड़ता है क्योंकि इसकी एक श्रृंखला है। कुछ लोगों ने स्थगन लिया  लेकिन हमें उधारकर्ताओं को अपनी निधि से सभी के लिए ब्याज देना पड़ा और उन्हें उच्च और शुष्क नहीं छोड़ सकते क्योंकि हम अधिस्थगन लेने वालों को लाभ दे रहे थे।   बार और बेंच से इनपुट्स   supreme court adjourned to tomorrow the hearing on the pleas seeking an extension of the loan moratorium period and waiver of interest on interest on term loans  in view of the covid 19 pandemic pic.

विज्ञापनsamsung galaxy s20 fe review  डिजाइन और डिस्प्लेsamsung galaxy s20 fe review  फोटो   प्रदीप पाण्डेयसैमसंग ने इस फोन को शानदार कलर में पेश किया है। गैलेक्सी एस20 एफई को क्लाउड नेवी  क्लाउड व्हाइट  क्लाउड लावेंडर  क्लाउड मिंट और क्लाउड रेड कलर में खरीदा जा सकता है। रिव्यू के लिए हमने क्लाउड मिंट वेरियंट का इस्तेमाल किया। गैलेक्सी एस20 एफई सैमसंग का पहला फोन है जिसके बैक पैनल पर मैट फिनिश ग्लास्टिक दी गई है। कुछ हद तक यह सिलिकॉन कोटिंग जैसा है। इस फिनिशिंग का फायदा यह है कि बैक पैनल पर उंगलियों के निशान नहीं आते हैं और फोन हाथ से फिसलता नहीं है।  सभी तरह के बटन को राइट में जगह मिली है। बैक पैनल पर तीन लेंश के साथ कैमरा दिया गया है। कैमरे के सेटअप का आकार आयताकार है और उभार के साथ आता है। ऐसे में बिना मजबूत बैक कवर फोन को इस्तेमाल करने पर कैमरा लेंस टूटने या उस पर स्क्रैच आने का डर रहता है। फोन की बॉडी प्लास्टिक की ही है  लेकिन मेटल फ्रेम का इस्तेमाल किया गया है।  सिम कार्ट ट्रे को फोन के टॉप पर जगह मिली है। नीचे की ओर सिंगल स्पीकर  माइक्रोफोन और यूएसबी टाइप सी चार्जिंग पोर्ट दिया गया है। इस फोन का वजन 190 ग्राम है। फोन में 6.
5 इंच की फुल एचडी प्लस डिस्प्ले दी गई है जो कि सुपर एमोलेड है। डिस्प्ले का रिजॉल्यूशन 1080x2400 पिक्सल है। डिस्प्ले के साथ शार्पनेस  कलर और कॉन्ट्रास्ट शानदार है। डिस्प्ले पर गोरिल्ला ग्लास 3 का प्रोटेक्शन है। डिस्प्ले की रिफ्रेश रेट 120 गीगाहर्ट्ज है। कड़ी धूप या अंधेरे में डिस्प्ले को लेकर कोई समस्या नहीं है। गेमिंग और वीडियो स्ट्रीमिंग के लिहाज से डिस्प्ले अच्छी है। तो कुल मिलाकर हम यही कहेंगे कि डिजाइन के मामले में सैमसंग गैलेक्सी अपनी रेंज में एक बढ़िया फोन है।  samsung galaxy s20 fe review  हार्डवेयर और सॉफ्टवेयरsamsung galaxy s20 fe review  फोटो   प्रदीप पाण्डेयसैमसंग के इस फोन में exynos 990 प्रोसेसर है जिसका इस्तेमाल सैमसंग ने इससे पहले गैलेक्सी नोट 20  गैलेक्सी नोट 20 अल्ट्रा और गैलेक्सी एस20 प्लस में इस्तेमाल किया है  जबकि ग्लोबल वेरियंट को स्नैपड्रैगन 865 प्रोसेसर के साथ लॉन्च किया गया है। exynos 990 को 7 नैनोमीटर प्रोसेस पर तैयार किया गया है। यह प्रोसेसर 5जी को भी सपोर्ट करता है  हालांकि फोन के भारतीय वेरियंट में 5जी मॉडम को डिसेबल करके लॉन्च किया गया है। ग्राफिक्स के लिए इसमें mali g77 जीपीयू मिलेगा। सैमसंग के इस प्रोसेसर की तुलना क्वॉलकॉम स्नैपड्रैगन 855 प्रोसेसर से होती है।  सैमसंग के इस फोन में एंड्रॉयड 10 आधारित one ui 2.
0 मिलेगा। इसके अलावा इस फोन में 8 जीबी तक रैम के साथ 128/256 जीबी तक की स्टोरेज दी गई है। फोन वायरलेस चार्जिंग और वायरलेस पावर शेयर फीचर भी दिया गया है। इस फोन में सैमसंग डेक्स का भी सपोर्ट है। साथ ही आप फोन को विंडोज लैपटॉप या कंप्यूटर से कनेक्ट कर सकते हैं। मल्टीटास्किंग और एप स्विचिंग के दौरान किसी तरह की कोई समस्या है। हमने प्राइमरी फोन के तौर पर सैमसंग के इस फोन को 15 दिनों तक इस्तेमाल किया है। वैसे तो exynos 990 एक जाना पहचाना और इस्तेमाल किया हुआ प्रोसेसर है  लेकिन गैलेक्सी एस20 एफई हल्के गेम और वीडियो स्ट्रीमिंग पर भी गर्म हो जाता है। 10 15 मिनट वीडियो देखने पर फोन गर्म हो जाता है। फोन का टेंपरेचर आप नीचे स्क्रीनशॉट में देख सकते हैं।  फोन में अटकने या हैंग होने जैसी कोई दिक्कत नहीं है। डेली इस्तेमाल में किसी तरह की कोई परेशानी नहीं है। फोन के साथ बैटरी और स्टोरेज ऑप्टिमाइजेशन मिलता है। सिक्योरिटी के लिए इसमें knox सिक्योरिटी  सिक्योर फोल्डर  इन डिस्प्ले फिंगरप्रिंट सेंसर और फेस अनलॉक है। इन डिस्प्ले फिंगरप्रिंट पहले के मुकाबले तो फास्ट है लेकिन बाजार में अन्य फोन की तरह फास्ट नहीं है। यही हाल फेस अनलॉक की भी है। फोन के साथ एक एज पैनल भी मिलता है जिसमें आप अधिक इस्तेमाल होने वाले एप को रख सकते हैं। फोन में अलवेज ऑन डिस्प्ले  फोकस मोड  डॉल्बी एटमॉस  स्क्रीन रिकॉर्डर और डार्क मोड जैसे फीचर्स मिलते हैं। फोन की ऑडियो क्वालिटी अच्छी है।  samsung galaxy s20 fe review  कैमराsamsung galaxy s20 fe review  फोटो   प्रदीप पाण्डेयकैमरे की बात करें तो इस फोन ट्रिपल रियर कैमरा सेटअप है जिसमें मेन कैमरा 12 मेगापिक्सल का है जिसका अपर्चर f/1.
8 है। वहीं दूसरा लेंस 12 मेगापिक्सल का अल्ट्रा वाइड है जिसका अपर्चर f/2.
2 है और तीसरा 8 मेगापिक्सल का टेलीफोटो लेंस है जिसके साथ 30x जूम मिलता है।  फोन के साथ मैक्रो लेंस या मैक्रो मोड आपको नहीं मिलता है  हालांकि ऑप्टिकल इमेज स्टेबलाइजेशन जरूर मिलता है। इसके अलावा प्रो मोड  लाइव फोकस मोड  स्लो मोशन  सुपर स्लो मोशन  प्रो वीडियो और लाइव फोकस वीडियो मोड मिलता है।लाइव फोकस वीडियो मोड की मदद से आप बैकग्राउंड ब्लर करके वीडियो रिकॉर्ड कर सकते हैं। रियर और फ्रंट दोनों कैमरे से आप 4के वीडियो रिकॉर्डिंग कर सकते हैं। सेल्फी के लिए इस फोन में 32 मेगापिक्सल का फ्रंट कैमरा दिया गया है। सेल्फी की क्वालिटी अच्छी है। टेलीफोटो लेंस के साथ जूम करने पर फोटो की क्वालिटी खराब होती है।  सीधे शब्दों में कहें तो 10एक्स जूम तक तो फोटो की क्वालिटी ठीक रहती है लेकिन उसके बाद डल होने लगती है। तस्वीरें आप देख सकते हैं। पर्याप्त रौशनी में फोटो की क्वालिटी बरकरार रहती है। नाइट मोड कुछ खास नहीं है। अल्ट्रा वाइड में भी फोटो की क्वालिटी खराब होती है।  samsung galaxy s20 fe की बैटरी और कनेक्टिविटीsamsung galaxy s20 fe  फोटो   प्रदीप पाण्डेयसैमसंग के इस फोन में 5g के अलावा 4g lte  वाई फाई  ब्लूटूथ v5.

इसे टचलेस कंट्रोल के लिए इस्तेमाल किया जाएगा.
oneplus के मुताबिक़ oneplus 8t concept को 39 डिजाइनर्स ने मिल कर डिजाइन किया है.
ये डिजाइनर्स चीन  ताइपेई  अमेरिका और भारत के हैं.
फोन का रियर पैनल नैचुरल एलिमेंट्स से इंस्पायर्ड है और कलर चेंज होता है.
फ़ोन का रियर पैनल ग्लास का ही है जिसमें मेटल ऑक्साइड यूज किया गया है.

यानी एक कलर से दूसरे कलर में शिफ़्ट करता है.

ग़ौरतलब है कि oneplus 8t concept को फिलहाल बेचा नहीं जाएगा.
ये कॉन्सेप्ट फोन है और कंपनी ने ये दिखाया है कि फोन से और क्या कुछ हासिल किया जा सकता है.
कंपनी इसे आने वाले समय में लॉन्च भी कर सकती है.

2 अरब देकर उसे बचाया था। इसमें से 3 अरब डॉलर कैश लोन था। बाकी 3.
2 अरब डॉलर ऑयल क्रेडिट फेसेलिटी के तौर पर दिए गए थे।  तीसरी किस्त बाकी  पाकिस्तान के अखबार ‘द डॉन’ की एक रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक  पाकिस्तान की इमरान खान सरकार चीन से 2 अरब डॉलर लेकर सऊदी अरब को दो किस्तें दे चुकी है। अब तीसरी किस्त जनवरी में चुकाई जानी है। इसको लेकर भी इमरान सरकार बेहद दबाव में है। इसकी वजह यह है कि उसके पास यह लोन चुकाने के लिए पैसा नहीं है और ऐसे में फिर चीन से उधार मांगना पड़ेगा।  सऊदी ने चौंकाया  अखबार की रिपोर्ट कहती है कि सऊदी अरब कर्ज चुकाने के लिए जिस तरह का दबाव पाकिस्तान पर बना रहा है  वैसा अमूमन वो कभी और किसी देश के साथ नहीं करता। और अकेला सऊदी ही क्यों  संयुक्त अरब अमीरात यानी यूएई भी पाकिस्तान पर तेजी से शिकंजा कस रहा है। इमरान सरकार सिर्फ कर्ज चुकाकर राहत नहीं पा सकती। जानकार पूछ रहे हैं कि 3.
2 अरब डॉलर की उस ऑयल क्रेडिट का क्या होगा जिसके जरिए पाकिस्तान सरकार को सऊदी से उधार में तेल खरीदना है। अगर सऊदी ने यह ऑयल क्रेडिट बंद कर दी तो पाकिस्तान में हाहाकार मच जाएगा क्योंकि उसके पास तेल नकद में खरीदने के लिए पैसा नहीं है।  चीन ही निकालेगा मुसीबत से  पाकिस्तान की फॉरेन मिनिस्ट्री के एक अफसर ने इन सवालों का एक ही जवाब दिया। कहा  चीन हमें मुसीबत से निकालेगा। फाइनेंस मिनिस्ट्री के एक अफसर ने कहा  चीन के कमर्शियल बैंकों से हमारी बातचीत चल रही है। कुछ खबरों में कहा गया है कि पाकिस्तान को सऊदी ने यह कर्ज अक्टूबर 2018 में दिया था। कुछ रिपोर्ट्स बताती हैं कि यह लोन 2019 जनवरी में दिया गया था।  आर्मी चीफ का दौरा काम नहीं आया  सऊदी अरब ने जब पाकिस्तान से कर्ज लौटाने को कहा तो पाकिस्तान के आर्मी चीफ जनरल बाजवा फौरन रियाद पहुंचे। वहां के अफसरों से बातचीत की। खास बात ये है कि सऊदी प्रिंस सलमान उनसे नहीं मिले। इस महीने भी बाजवा ने इस्लामाबाद में सऊदी एम्बेसेडर से मुलाकात की थी। लेकिन  वहां से भी राहत नहीं मिली।  अमेरिका ने पाकिस्तान को चेतावनी दी थी  कुछ दिन पहले अमेरिका ने पाकिस्तान को साफ शब्दों में चेतावनी देते हुए कहा था कि वो चीनी कर्ज के जाल में न फंसे। अमेरिका ने कहा था कि चीन कुछ और मुल्कों के साथ यही कर चुका है। अमेरिकी विदेश विभाग ने कहा था  पाकिस्तान चीनी कर्ज के दलदल में फंसता जा रहा है। 6 अरब डॉलर का सीपैक उसकी अर्थव्यवस्था को तहसनहस कर सकता है।",merge of debt  for the second time in 3 months  pakistan paid a debt from china to saudi arabia  still a billion dollars outstanding

"mohammad mobashir rahman s first half strike helped jamshedpur fc record a morale boosting 1 0 win over odisha fc in the indian super league 2020 21 match in bambolim on monday.
mobashir scored a 41st minute goal which proved to be the difference between the two sides  ending jfc s five game winless streak and keeping their playoff hopes alive.
stuart baxter made two changes from odisha s 1 1 draw against bengaluru  handing a start to bradden inman who had joined on loan from atk mohun bagan.
paul ramfangzauva was the other change in the playing xi.
for jamshedpur  centre back peter hartley returned from injury and mobashir replaced aitor monroy.
odisha custodian arshdeep singh was called into action early on.
seiminlen doungel dispossessed rakesh pradhan and  on entering the penalty area  forced a save from singh.
odisha should have scored in what would have been a well worked team goal.
ramfangzauva set jerry mawihmingthanga through in the jamshedpur penalty area  and the latter beat a marker before losing possession to narender gahlot.
the ball rolled towards manuel onwu  who fumbled in front of the goal  before being cleared out for a corner.
jamshedpur defenders were at their best despite being under a lot of pressure with stephen eze and hartley managing to thwart dangers posed by their opponents.
doungel was impressive for jfc and may have finally found a place that could get the best out of him.
he nearly assisted a goal at the half hour mark but farukh choudhary struck over the bar.
jfc finally broke the deadlock in the 41st minute through mobashir.
the youngster put in a cross for nerijus valskis  whose movement in the box confused singh  and the ball went straight into the goal.
doungel continued to trouble the odisha defense after the restart.
after getting the ball on the flank  he cut inside and tested singh  who pushed the ball out for a corner.
singh was called into action once again when alexandre lima tried his luck from a distance only to see his effort saved.
odisha kept attacking but poor passing in the final third saw them lose possession and hardly test the keeper.
at the other end  singh kept his side in the game with yet another save to deny choudhary.
odisha had a late penalty claim when diego mauricio was tripped in the area by t.
p.
rehenesh but the referee turned down the appeal.

"the budget has used the covid crisis as an opportunity to bring in the necessary focus on infrastructure investments and building capabilities.
it is laudable that the earlier initiatives have been continued at the same time.
it is clear that the finance minister has heard  assimilated and chosen to find solutions for most of the points brought to her notice.
each of the six themes have clear budgetary allocations made for the same  which will help in execution.
the finance minister has allowed the fiscal deficit to increase and provided for earlier off budget provisions fully  the ministry pegs fy21 fiscal deficit at 9.
5 per cent and fy22 deficit at 6.
8 per cent of gdp  while relying on disinvestments and tax revenues to help bring the deficit down to 4.
5 per cent only  by 2026  which allows enough head room to continue to make necessary investments going forward as well.
health sector push  the budget takes off on the various covid related schemes announced by the finance minister during the course of last year and is focusing on the infrastructure spend to spur growth and create demand.
the budget outlay of ₹2 23 846 crore for fy22 with a sharp focus on the health sector.
well being and the continued focus on important initiatives such as the swachh bharat abhiyaan and the atmanirbhar bharat scheme are to be commended.
in order to make atmanirbhar bharat successful  the finance minister has rightly pointed out that logistics costs need to be brought down.
focusing on multi modal transport  with railways simultaneously working together with the road network  is essential to make this happen.
the budgetary allocation of ₹1 10 055 crore for the eastern and western dedicated freight corridor  which will be operational by june  2022  as also the new corridors on east coast  east north corridor and the north south corridor to be initiated  is a very welcome move.
the logistics sector will be further enthused by the outsourcing of port operations in tier 2 ports.
the continuous upgradation of the highway infrastructure  boosted by the allocation of ₹1 18 101 crore for ministry of road transport and highways  will further bring down the transportation and logistics cost and provide the necessary fillip to the pli schemes announced by the government.
the transport community will have to use the scrappage policy  will have to await the full details  to prepare themselves for the future requirements of the hub and spoke model.
logistics sector  the ₹3 000 crore being spent for continuing the apprenticeship scheme will enable the logistics sector significantly increase employment.
the finance minister is aware of the impact of logistics and supply chain sectors and their importance to make the atmanirbhar bharat scheme focus on manufacturing successful.
the fact that some of the infrastructure creation is going to be funded by the partial sale of such assets should ensure that they will be maintained going forward also.
i am sure  in order to utilise these assets better  the country will look at an outsourcing policy which will increase the utilisation level of the created infrastructure in the future.
this budget will accelerate the growth achieved in the last few months and provide the necessary impetus for private sector investments to support the government focus and infrastructure spend.
with this  we should be looking at double digit growth not only in 2022  but also in the next few years.
a big thanks to the finance minister for walking the talk and executing her promise.

"moneycontrol द्वारा प्रदत्त  केंद्र सरकार ने उन 4 सरकारी बैंकों को शॉर्टलिस्ट कर लिया है जिनका प्राइवेटाइजेशन होना है। जिन बैंकों को निजीकरण के लिए चयनित किया गया है  उनमें उनमें बैंक ऑफ महाराष्ट्र  bank of maharashtra   बैंक ऑफ इंडिया  bank of india  boi   इंडियन ओवरसीज बैंक  indian overseas bank  और सेंट्रल बैंक ऑफ इंडिया  central bank of india  शामिल हैं। समाचार एजेंसी रायटर्स की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक  इन 4 में 2 बैंकों का प्राइवेटाइजेशन अगले वित्त वर्ष यानी 2021 22 में हो सकता है। हालांकि  सरकार ने अभी प्राइवेट होने वाले बैंकों का नाम औपचारिक तौर पर सार्वजनिक नहीं किया है।  इस रिपोर्ट में 3 सूत्रों के हवाले से कहा गया है कि केंद्र सरकार बैंक प्राइवेटाइजेशन के लिए फिलहाल छोटे बैंकों से कदम आगे बढ़ा सकती है  क्योंकि इससे सराकर को यह अंदाजा हो जाएगा कि बैंकों के निजीकरण में उस किस तरह की परेशानियों का सामना करना पड़ेगा  क्योंकि यह कदम मोदी सरकार से लिए जोखिम से भरा हुआ है। चूंकि  बैंक प्राइवेटाइजेशन से लोगों की नौकरियां जाने का खतरा है  इस वजह से बैंक यूनियन इसका विरेध कर रहे हैं। सूत्रों ने यह भी बताया कि आने वाले वर्षों में बड़े बैंकों को भी बेचने की प्रक्रिया शुरू हो सकती है। हालांकि  स्टेट बैंक ऑफ इंडिया  sbi  में सरकार अपनी बड़ी हिस्सेदारी रखना जारी रखेगी  क्योंकि इसके जरिये देश के ग्रामीण इलाके में कई सरकारी योजनाएं चलाई जाती हैं।  सरकार के लिए जोखिम भरा फैसला  सूत्रों ने बताया कि बैंकों के प्राइवेटाइजेशन की प्रक्रिया 5 से 6 महीने में शुरू होने की उम्मीद है। सरकारी बैंकों का प्राइवेटाइजेशन मोदी सरकार के लिए जोखिम भरा फैसला है  क्योंकि यह लोगों के रोजगार से जुड़ा मामला है। बैंक यूनियन सरकार के इस फैसले के खिलीफ सोमवार यानी आज से ही दो दिवसीय हड़ताल पर हैं। केंद्र सराकर को डर है कि कहीं इस मामले में भी किसान आंदोलन जैसा विरोध नहीं झेलना पड़े  इसलिए सरकार पहले मिड साइज बैंकों का निजीकरण करेगी  जहां काम करने वाले लोगों की संख्या कम है। बैंकिंग सेक्टर में सरकार की बड़ी हिस्सेदारी है  जिसमें हजारों कर्मचारी काम करते हैं। प्राइवेटाइजेशन राजनीतिक रूप से बहुत जोखिम वाला काम है  क्योंकि इससे रोजगार का खतरा पैदा हो सकता है।  ग्राहकों पर नहीं होगा असर  बैंकिंग एक्सपर्ट्स का कहना है कि इन बैंकों के प्राइवेट होने पर ग्राहकों के अकाउंट उनमें जमा राशि पर कोई पर खास असर नहीं पड़ेगा। जब बैंकों का निजीकरण होता है तब बैंक पहले की तरह अपनी सर्विस बरकरार रखते हैं। साथ ही  होम  पर्सनल और ऑटो लोन की ब्याज दरें और सुविधाएं भी पहले जैसे ही रहती हैं। निजीकरण के बाद ग्राहकों को और बेहतर सुविधाएं मिलती हैं।  बैंक ऑफ महाराष्ट्र से हो सकती है शुरुआत  केंद्र सरकार सोची समझी रणनीति के तहत पहले छोटे और मिड साइज psu बैंको का निजीकरण करने जा रही है। आपतो बता दें कि बैंक ऑफ इंडिया  boi  में 50 000 को करीब कर्मचारी काम करते हैं और सेंट्रल बैंक ऑफ इंडिया में काम करने वाले लोगों की संख्या 33 000 के करीब है। वहीं  इंडियन ओवरसीज बैंक में 26 000 और बैंक ऑफ महाराष्ट्र में 13 000 कर्मचारी काम करते हैं। इस वजह से उम्मीद है कि सरकार पहले बैंक ऑफ महाराष्ट्र के निजीकरण की प्रक्रिया शुरू कर सकती है  क्योंकि कर्मचारियों की संख्या कम होने से सरकार को कम विरोध झेलना होगा।  सरकार के फैसले पर होगा इन कारकों का असर  केंद्र सरकार ने अगले वित्त वर्ष में विनिवेश  disinvestment  के जरिये 1.
75 लाख करोड़ रुपये जुटाने का लक्ष्य रखा है  ताकि वह कल्याणकारी योजनाओं पर खर्च कर सके। इसी दिशा में राजस्व जुटाने के लिए सरकार ने बजट 2021 में 4 सरकारी बैंकों और एक इंश्योरेंस कंपनी के प्राइवेटाइजेशन का प्रस्ताव रखा। बैंकों के प्राइवेटाइजेशन में सरकार बैंक में कर्मचारियों की संख्या  ट्रेड यूनियन का दबाव और इसके राजनीतिक असर का आकलन करने के बाद ही अपना फाइनल डिसीजन लेगी।  सोशल मीडिया अपडेट्स के लिए हमें facebook  https //www.

"hmd plans to launch affordable 5g nokia phones in india  by varindia   2021 02 02  hmd global is eyeing to make india a hub for its global supply chain while also launching affordable 5g nokia phones in the country this year  as revealed by the company’s vice president sanmeet kocchar.
hmd global is looking to launch customised smartphones in the indian market and for this it recently teamed up with dixon technologies  which is one of the largest consumer electronics solutions companies in india to produce nokia phones  said the executive.
hmd global had secured  230 million from google  qualcomm  and nokia technologies in 2020 and is now aiming to invest in capacity expansion.
this also includes investing in indian manufacturing and distribution as well.
we are looking at india as an important market and the first thing that we are going to do is look at products which are customized for the indian market.
second is 5g  which is an important space that we have decided to play in  and we are looking at how we can launch more affordable 5g devices this year   said hmd global’s vice president  sanmeet kocchar.
in the regulatory filing about the partnership  dixon said that its subsidiary  padget electronics would make nokia smartphones at the nodia facility in uttar pradesh.
the top executive added that the company has expanded its distribution in india with 700 plus partners  thereby strengthening its offline presence.
furthermore  kocchar said that going forward hmd global aims for better product differentiation through future proof software that would last for at least a couple of years before upgrading.
reiterating their commitment to the ‘make in india’ initiative  the executive said it is manufacturing 100 percent of its devices in india and that the pli scheme is also a great initiative from the government.

sanmeet says there is steady progress in terms of the number of components that are sourced in india and the quantity of components that are being procured from india has gone up.
however  the company says that it doesn’t have plans to set up its own factories at the moment  instead  it intends to work with partners for manufacturing  production  and distribution.

"महागठबंधन की पूरी कमान तेजस्‍वी यादव ने संभाल रखी है। वे महागठबंधन के सीएम कैंडिडेट हैं। इस बीच उन्‍होंने दैनिक जागरण के स्टेट ब्यूरो हेड अरविंद शर्मा ने उनसे चिराग और कन्‍हैया से दूरी दस लाख रोजगार सहित कई मु्द्दों पर बात की। प्रस्‍तुत है इंटरव्‍यू के प्रमुख अंश  पटना  अरविंद शर्मा  बिहार में युवा राजनीति के नए प्रतीक और महागठबंधन के मुख्यमंत्री का चेहरा तेजस्वी यादव इन दिनों चुनावी सभाओं में अति व्यस्त हैं। आम लोगों से मिल रहे हैं। संवाद कर रहे हैं। बिहार की तस्वीर बदलने का वादा कर रहे हैं। महागठबंधन के प्रत्याशियों की ओर से रैलियों और सभाओं के लिए सबसे ज्यादा मांग तेजस्वी की ही है। इसलिए एक एक दिन में उन्हें 17 17 सभाएं करनी पड़ रही है। उनका पूरा दिन मंचों  सभाओं और प्रत्याशियों के बीच ही गुजरता है। प्रस्तुत है प्रमुख अंश    1.
चुनाव में आप बहुत मेहनत कर रहे हैं तो शुरुआत इसी से करते हैं कि आपको कितनी सीटों की उम्मीद है   हमें उम्मीद ही नहीं  पूरा विश्वास है कि महागठबंधन दो तिहाई बहुमत के साथ बिहार में अगली सरकार बनाने जा रहा है। जिस तरह से आज आम लोग त्रस्त हैं  यह संख्या ऊपर जा सकती है  पर कम होती नहीं दिख रही है।  2.
दस लाख नौकरियों को लेकर आम लोगों में बड़ा कन्फ्यूजन है। आप नौकरी देंगे या रोजगार  संविदा की सारी नौकरियों को भी स्थाई करने का आपने वादा किया है। पहले से जो संविदा पर हैं  उन्हें परमानेंट करने का भरोसा दिया है। कहां से और कैसे आएगा इतना संसाधन     हमने स्पष्ट शब्दों में 10 लाख स्थाई व सरकारी नौकरियों की बात कही है। इसे लेकर किसी के भी मन में संशय या भ्रम नहीं है। इसके अलावा हम संगठित व असंगठित क्षेत्र में रोजगार के पर्याप्त मौके उत्पन्न करेंगे। यह तभी संभव है  जब सेवा  निर्माण व कृषि क्षेत्र के विकास पर पर्याप्त ध्यान दिया जाए। पूंजी निवेश को आसान व आकर्षक बनाया जाए। ऋण आसानी से मिल जाए और आधारभूत संरचना सुलभ हो। हमारी सरकार सभी पहलुओं पर ध्यान देते हुए आगे बढ़ेगी। इसके अलावा कुटीर  छोटे व मध्यम उद्योगों के विकास के लिए भी प्रशिक्षण  ऋण व अनुदान की व्यवस्था करेगी। जब सरकारी व गैर सरकारी  संगठित असंगठित  सेवा व निर्माण  कृषि व उससे जुड़ी गतिविधियों को मदद मिलेगी तो अर्थव्यवस्था स्वाभाविक रूप से तेज़ी से बढ़ेगी  जिससे रोजग़ार व नौकरियों के अवसर ही उत्पन्न नहीं होंगे  बल्कि सरकार की आय में भी वृद्धि होगी। इस बढ़ी हुई आय से सरकार शिक्षा  स्वास्थ्य  जन कल्याण व आधारभूत संरचना को बेहतर ही नहीं कर सकती  बल्कि लाखों संविदा कॢमयों को भी स्थायी कर सकती है। बस ज़रूरत है योजना बनाकर इच्छाशक्ति के साथ चलने की। एनडीए सरकार बताए कि संविदाकॢमयों को स्थायी क्यों नहीं किया   3.
आपने राजद को एटूजेड की पार्टी बनाने का वादा किया था। आबादी के हिसाब से भागीदारी देने की बात कही थी। मगर टिकट वितरण में ऐसा कुछ नहीं दिखा। सवर्ण जातियों को फिर नजरअंदाज किया गया।   यह कहना सही नहीं है। राजद और महागठबंधन ने आपसी सहमति और गहन विचार विमर्श के बाद सभी जाति एवं वर्गों को उचित प्रतिनिधित्व दिया है। आप आंकड़े देख सकते हैं। हमने सभी वर्गों के लिए अपनी पार्टी का दरवाजा ही नहीं है  दिल भी खोला है।  4.
आप युवा हैं और सोच भी नई है। आज का राजद युवा सोच के मुताबिक कितना बन पाया है। लालू प्रसाद के जमाने से कितना आगे बढ़ पाया है।    अब हम पूरे बिहार की बात कर रहे हैं। हम लैपटॉप से और स्मार्टफ़ोन के टच से दुनिया को देखते हैं। नए दौर में स्वभाविक है नई सोच होगी। पूरे बिहार में राजद अकेली पार्टी है  जो सकारात्मक एजेंडे के साथ चुनाव में उतरी है। राजद प्रगति  जन सरोकार और रोजगार के मुद्दे के साथ ही आगे बढऩा चाहती है। ये जनता के वास्तविक मुद्दे हैं  जो उनके जीवन को प्रभावित करते हैं। हम लालू जी द्वारा लाए सामाजिक न्याय के दूसरे पड़ाव अर्थात आॢथक न्याय पर काम कर रहे हैं जो हर वर्ग के लोगों के जीवन पर सकारात्मक प्रभाव डालेगा। अब यह पहले से कितना आगे या अलग है  यह निर्णय तो जनता करेगी।  5.
राजद कार्यकर्ताओं में प्रचारित है कि आप किसी से मिलते जुलते नहीं हैं। विधायकों को भी इंतजार कराते हैं। यहां आपकी तुलना लालू जी से की जाती है कि उनका दरबार सबके लिए खुला रहता था  किंतु आपका.
.
.
यह गलत धारणा है। हमारा दरवाजा सदा खुला रहता है। बंद तो अणे मार्ग रहता है। मेरे पिता से मेरी तुलना बेमानी है। हममें एक पीढ़ी का अंतर है तो स्वाभाविक है कुछ चीजें भी अलग होंगी। सबका काम करने का तौर तरीक़ा अलग अलग होता है। क्या आपका तरीक़ा अपने पिता से अलग नहीं है  पहले नेता पैदल चुनाव प्रचार करते थे। अब गाडिय़ों से करते हैं। जमाने के साथ चीजें भी बदली हैं। अब हार्ड वर्क के साथ स्मार्ट वर्क का भी ज़माना है।  6.
भाजपा लोजपा के ताजा स्टैंड को आप किस रूप में देखते हैं। मैं सिर्फ इस विधानसभा चुनाव की बात कर रहा हूं। लोग बता रहे हैं कि दोनों दल मिलकर जदयू को परेशान कर रहे हैं। आप कितना सहमत हैं     देखिए  एनडीए के अंदर के खेल को समझने में मैं ऊर्जा व्यय नहीं करना चाहता। मैं बेहतर  विकसित और नए बिहार एव बेरोजगारी मिटाने के एक सकारात्मक एजेंडे के साथ बढ़ रहा हूं  जिससे त्रस्त जनता मुझमें विश्वास दिखा रही है। यह बड़ी जिम्मेदारी है। समय सीमित है और बिहार की बेहतरी के लिए जरूरी है कि मैं इस संदेश को जन जन तक पहुंचाऊं। नीतीश जी से पूरा बिहार परेशान है। इसी फेहरिस्त में चिराग जी भी शामिल हैं तो इसमें कौन सी बड़ी बात है  चिराग जी तो कह रहे हैं वो भाजपा का ही मुख्यमंत्री बनाना चाहते है और भाजपा ने इसका खंडन भी नहीं किया है। व्यक्तिगत तौर पर मैं इस जोड़तोड़ और भितरघात की राजनीति से सरोकार नहीं रखता हूं।  7.
अब संभावनाओं पर सवाल। अगर किसी दल को बहुमत नहीं मिला तो बिहार को एक और चुनाव में धकेलने से बचाने के लिए क्या आप भाजपा या जदयू को समर्थन देंगे या जरूरत पड़ेगी तो समर्थन लेना पसंद करेंगे  ऐसी स्थिति आई तो आप दोनों में से किसे चुनेंगे     हमें दो तिहाई पूर्ण बहुमत मिलने जा रहा है। दोनों एक ही टीम के सदस्य हैं। बस जर्सी अलग है। एक की जनविरोधी  संविधान विरोधी विचारधारा हमें स्वीकार नहीं और दूसरे की सिद्धांतहीन कुर्सीवादी राजनीति मंजूर नहीं।  8.
आप अगर बड़े दल के रूप में उभरते हैं और बहुमत से दूर रहते हैं तो क्या अपने पुराने साथियों से समर्थन मांगेंगे। जीतनराम मांझी  उपेंद्र कुशवाहा और मुकेश सहनी से समर्थन लेने पर क्या विचार है     जब हमें दो तिहाई बहुमत मिलने जा रहा है तो कल्पना में क्यों विचरण करना।  9.
चिराग पासवान या कन्हैया कुमार से आपकी राजनीतिक दूरी क्यों बनी रहती है  मिलना जुलना भी नहीं होता है। कोई डर है या रणनीति    चिराग पासवान से हमारा पारिवारिक रिश्ता है। सुख दुख में हम मिलते हैं। राजनीतिक रूप से वो एनडीए गठबंधन में हैं तो स्वाभाविक रूप से राजनीतिक दूरी है। राजनीति में अगर आप जन सरोकार के सकारात्मक एजेंडे के साथ व जनता के साथ खड़े हों तो किसी से डर कैसा  कन्हैया हमारे गठबंधन में हैं और प्रचार कर रहे हैं।  शॉर्ट मे जानें सभी बड़ी खबरें और पायें ई पेपर ऑडियो न्यूज़ और अन्य सर्विस  डाउनलोड जागरण ऐप",exclusive interview  we do not have the door of rjd for everyone  the heart has also opened  stunning

kisan protest   आज देश भर के जिला मुख्‍यालयों पर किसान करेंगे अनशन और प्रदर्शन  दिल्‍ली जयपुर हाईवे बाधित  kisan protest   किसान नेताओं ने कहा कि सोमवार को पूरे देश में किसान भाजपा नेताओं के घरों के बाहर धरना प्रदर्शन करेंगे। जिला मुख्यालयों पर भी प्रदर्शन करके ज्ञापन सौंपा जाएगा। किसानों ने बातचीत का रास्ता बंद नहीं किया है। सोमवार को धरनास्थल पर किसान नेता एक दिन का अनशन करेंगे। दिल्‍ली के मुख्यमंत्री अरविद केजरीवाल ने रविवार को डिजिटल प्रेसवार्ता कर घोषणा की है कि वह भी सोमवार को किसानों के समर्थन में एक दिन का उपवास रखेंगे। इसके साथ ही उन्होंने आम आदमी पार्टी  आप  के कार्यकर्ताओं और देशवासियों से अपील कि वे भी उपवास रखें। इससे पहले रविवार को कृषि कानूनों का विरोध कर रहे किसानों के समर्थन में राजस्थान से आए विभिन्न संगठनों से जुड़े कार्यकर्ता एवं आंदोलनकारी दिल्ली जयपुर हाईवे पर बैठ गए और पूरा रोड जाम कर दिया। इससे दोनों ओर वाहनों की लंबी लाइन लग गई। हालांकि शाम करीब 5ः30 बजे दिल्ली से जयपुर जाने वाली लेन पर ट्रैफिक को खोल दिया गया है। इससे कुछ राहत मिली है। कुंडली बार्डर पर पत्रकारों से बातचीत करते हुए किसान नेताओं ने कहा कि अब तक सरकार की ओर से पांच संशोधन और एमएसपी की गारंटी देने का प्रस्ताव आया है  जिसे किसान खारिज कर चुके हैं।  अब तक सरकार की ओर से पांच संशोधन और एमएसपी की गारंटी देने का प्रस्ताव आया है  जिसे किसान खारिज कर चुके हैं। सिघु व टीकरी बार्डर पर बैठे किसानों की राय भी बदलने लगी है। कई किसानों का मानना है कि आंदोलन अपनी जगह ठीक है  लेकिन इससे लोगों की परेशानी धीरे धीरे बढ़ रही है। ऐसे में दोनों बार्डरों पर कम से कम एक लेन खोलने पर विचार किया जाना चाहिए।  posted by  navodit saktawat  नईदुनिया ई पेपर पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करे  नईदुनिया ई पेपर पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करे  डाउनलोड करें नईदुनिया ऐप   पाएं मध्यप्रदेश  छत्तीसगढ़ और देश दुनिया की सभी खबरों के साथ नईदुनिया ई पेपर राशिफल और कई फायदेमंद सर्विसेस  डाउनलोड करें नईदुनिया ऐप   पाएं मध्यप्रदेश  छत्तीसगढ़ और देश दुनिया की सभी खबरों के साथ नईदुनिया ई पेपर राशिफल और कई फायदेमंद सर्विसेस,kisan protest  farmers will be hidden on the district headquarters around the country today  delhi jaipur highway interrupted

"highlights of the c5 aircross  design  architecture and dimensions  the citroen advanced comfort programme  interior ambience  comfort seats and luggage capacity  driving and safety aids  powertrain  new delhi  citroen announced its entry in the indian market back in 2019 and in the year 2021  we finally have some action coming from the automaker.
citroen c5 aircross will be the french automaker’s first offering in the indian market.
it definitely is a smart move considering the robust demand for suvs in india  but the automaker is far from promoting its new offering as a more than capable suv.
according to the french automaker  the usp of the c5 aircross is that it is a comfort class offering.
the citroen c5 aircross will be a very unique offering in india as it positions itself just below the luxury segment and a little above the premium suv segment and it could be the first comfort class offering that the indian audience will see.
it definitely is a big gamble  but it does seem like a reasonable one.
the indian audience already has a ton of luxury offerings and we haven’t seen much innovation there and then come the hot picks of the market that include the fast paced budget suv and the hot hatch segment that have pampered the market with a ton of premium features already.
citroen is ready to challenge the trend and seems quite prepared to convince the indian audience by showing that premium features and a premium experience don’t equal comfort class at all and also that the comfort level of a car is not limited to the in cabin experience alone.
toi auto takes a closer look at the c5 aircross suv to see how exactly is this offering going to cause a paradigm shift in the indian market.
before taking a look at all the comfort class features closely  let s list them out first to get an idea of what the suv has to offer.
some of the highlights of the citroen c5 aircross include the dynamic architecture with fresh exterior detailing  suspension with the progressive hydraulic cushions  advanced and flexible comfort seats  adjustable rear seats  redefined roominess  a wide range of driving and safety aids and the finely tuned powertrain.
the citroen c5 aircross looks like a comprehensive package up for offer which prioritizes the comfort of the occupants and offers an in cabin experience like never before.
what we usually see in the indian market is that suvs or cars in general  either focus too much on the features or the powertrain or the safety or the driver centric features  but rarely does a car manages to balance out all the elements.
the c5 aircross does look promising and seems to have attained an equilibrium throughout the elements but we’ll reserve our opinions until we actually get to drive the car pretty soon.
the citroen c5 aircross has a very unique design language compared to what we’ve seen in the indian market till now.
while the indian audience’s opinion on the looks may differ due to their preferences  but the muscular profile of the suv with bold and contemporary detailing on the exterior will definitely impress you.
despite having a muscular build  the suv doesn’t look bulky or aggressive at all and adorns that elegant stance with ease.
the 360 degree glazed surfaces highlighted by the chromed ‘c’ motif  the double chevron design  the curved side panels  the ‘swirl’ two tone alloy wheels  the rear lights with 3d modules make the suv stand apart from the crowd.
the c5 aircross is available in 4 body colours out of which 3 offer a bi tone roof option adding to the bold stance of the suv.
the citroen c5 aircross measures 4500x2099x1710mm which is enough to reflect on the roominess of the cabin.
the decent width and the height of the suv lay down a rough image of the knee room  legroom and the headroom that will be offered.
now we talk about the usp of the c5 aircross  the citroen advanced comfort features and the wide range of comforts they offer.
the citroen advanced comfort features are divided into 4 key themes  the flying carpet effect  cocooned in comfort  panoramic life and intuitive technology.
starting with the flying carpet effect  this feature might be the most suited for the indian driving conditions.
the c5 aircross comes with progressive hydraulic cushions that offer a specially designed suspension on both sides for rebound and compression for optimum comfort.
the hydraulic cushions can counter big bumps and minor road undulations with ease.
the second theme  cocooned in comfort  is about the exceptional in cabin experience offered by the suv.
the c5 aircross comes with double laminated front windows and acoustic windshield glass and that reduces the wind and the road noise to an absolute minimum.
the air quality system  aqs  further enhances the experience by automatically detecting  filtering and purifying the polluted air.
the third theme  panoramic life  has to offer a panoramic glass sunroof which is powered by dual electric motors with an in built auto reverse safety function.
you get to adjust the brightness levels as per your comfort.
the fourth theme  intuitive technology  is what exactly is the icing on the cake and complements the entire in cabin experience.
the c5 aircross offers tech like 12.
3 inch tft digital instrument cluster  8 inch touchscreen infotainment system and both the screens are highly customizable.
the 8 inch screen also offers the mirror screen feature which lets you mirror your smartphone.
the c5 aircross’s interior is quite aesthetic and the metropolitan grey ambience with grey grained leather and the graphite fabric upholstery offers a plush experience whenever you enter the car.
apart from the ambience  the advanced comfort seats don’t fail to impress you either.
the seats are aimed at offering a lounge like experience and high density foam used makes sure that the drives are comfortable no matter how long the journey is.
the rear seats of the car redefine the definition of comfort completely as they come with multiple reclining positions and they can also slide up to 150mm.
the foldable rear seats also result in a generous luggage capacity.
the standard boot space offered is 580 litres  but with the rear seats folded  it offers up to 1630 litres of space.
the citroen c5 aircross offers a range of safety and driving aid systems and some of the key features include automatic park assist  coffee break alert in long journeys  blind spot monitoring system  automatic citroen led vision  fog lights with cornering function  grip control with hill descent assist  hill start assist  reversing camera with top rear vision  keyless entry and start and electric parking brake.
now coming to the least focussed factor of the c5 aircross.
the suv does have an exceptional powertrain but it is a pity that it gets overshadowed by everything else that the car has to offer.
the suv is powered by a 2.
0 litre  4 cylinder diesel engine.
the 1997cc engine offers a power output of 177 ps and a peak torque of 400 nm.
the engine is paired to the new eat8 automatic gearbox.
the 8 speed automatic transmission is easy to handle and can be shifted using the paddle shifters too.
the suv also offers a grip control feature with 5 modes  standard  snow  all terrain  sand and traction control off.
the driving modes can be selected using a dial in the central console.
the citroen c5 aircross looks very promising and appears as the perfect candidate to bridge the gap between the luxury class and the premium class.
the c5 aircross is everything a person could get in an entry level luxury car but in a more compact and comprehensive package.
the c5 aircross also offers that little extra that everyone looks for in premium suvs.
expected to be priced at rs 30 lakh  ex showroom   the suv does offer the bang for your buck but the only thing that could rain on its parade is the fact that it still caters to a very niche audience.
the potential customers include the people wanting to downgrade from the luxury segment or the ones finding a value for money upgrade from a c suv or a premium suv.

"the budget 2021 22 has tightened provisions for high income earners taking advantage of popular tax saving investment options.
firstly  interest earned on pf contributions over ₹2.
5 lakh is taxable.
this provision shall be applicable on contributions made on or after april 1  2021.
this is a continuation of the government’s move last year to set an aggregate limit of ₹7.
5 lakh for employer contributions to the pf  national pension system  nps  and superannuation fund  any contribution beyond whichwas made taxable.
pf contributions enjoyed tax deduction under section 80c up to a maximum of ₹1.
5 lakh per year.
interest accrued is entirely tax free and so are withdrawals.
with the new proposal  interest on contribution of over ₹2.
5 lakh to employee provident fund  epf  will be taxed.
apart from high income earners whose pf contributions could exceed ₹2.
5 lakh  this provision could impact those who contribute to voluntary provident fund  vpf   too.
this is a popular low risk savings route since it provides fixed returns similar to the epf.
returns on other low risk fixed income instruments such as post office small savings schemes and bank deposits are market linked.
however  the segregation of interest on the existing corpus collected over the years and the one earned on the contribution over ₹2.
5 lakh a year for tax purposes may be easier said than done.
clarity is also needed on whether the tax will be applicable for the interest earned only on the incremental contribution above ₹2.
5 lakh or on the entire contribution.
by taxing the annual contribution to provident funds beyond ₹2.
5 lakh  high income earners using that route will be nudged towards moving to other avenues such as nps.
ulip lose tax edge  ulip  unit linked insurance plan  maturity proceeds are also not tax free any more.
the government has proposed to allow tax exemption for maturity proceeds of the ulip with annual premium up to ₹2.
5 lakh alone.
the cap of ₹2.
5 lakh on the annual premium of ulip shall be applicable only for the policies taken on or after february 1  2021.
the non exempt ulips shall be provided same capital gains taxation regime as available to the mutual fund.
however  the amount received on death shall remain exempt without any limit on the annual premium.
this proposal virtually ends the tax advantage that ulips  an investment plan with a dash of life insurance  enjoyed over mutual funds.
taking away this tax edge evens the playing ground because ulips were being used by many hnis to earn tax exempted returns.
long term capital gains  ltcg  arising out of the sale of units of equity oriented mutual fund schemes are taxed at 10 per cent if the ltcg exceed ₹1 lakh in a financial year  gains up to january 31  2018 being grandfathered.
however  the proceeds from ulips of insurance companies  including early surrender / partial withdrawals  are exempted from income tax under section 10 10d  of the income tax act.
so  even though ulips invest in equity stocks  just like mutual funds  they had an advantage  which is now being partially taken away.
ulips  however  still enjoy the advantage of tax deduction under section 80c of the income tax act on the premium paid  something which is enjoyed only by elss  tax saving funds.
other tightening measures  even after the expiry of the due date for filing returns  taxpayers were allowed to file belated returns with the payment of interest and penalty.
taxpayers could also revise their return filed in a particular year in case of any errors.
the deadline for filing revised returns was at the end of the assessment year or before the completion of the assessment  by it officer   whichever is earlier.
the budget has proposed to advance the deadline by three months.
thus the revised return can now be filed three months before the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of the assessment  whichever is earlier.
the budget also proposed a higher rate of tax deduction at source  tds   for those who did not file their income tax returns in any of the two previous years.
for such taxpayers  their current year’s incomes would be subject to a tds rate which is — 5 per cent or twice the rate of tds normally applicable for the said income  whichever is higher.
for instance  if your rental income in any year exceeded ₹2.
4 lakh  the tenant was required to deduct tds at 10 per cent on the rent.
now  if you haven’t filed your itr in both the previous years  the rate of tds on your rental income shall now be 20 per cent.
the budget has tightened rules for deposit of the contribution of employees towards various welfare funds by employers.
any delay on this count usually results in permanent loss of interest/income for the employees.
in order to ensure timely deposit of employees’ contribution to these funds by the employers  it has proposed to reiterate that that the late deposit of employees’ contribution by the employer shall never be allowed as deduction to the employer.

"california  us   a team of researchers has found that an enriched diet and companionship can reduce pain in mice with sickle cell disease by increasing serotonin.
they also discovered that duloxetine  an antidepressant that boosts serotonin levels  could be an alternative to opioids in treating chronic pain.
the results of the study led by researchers from the university of california  irvine  and the university of minnesota  have been published in the journal  scientific reports.
finding safe and effective alternatives to opioids is a research priority  especially for patients with sickle cell disease   said dr keith hoots  director of the division of blood diseases and resources at the national heart  lung  and blood institute.
it s encouraging to see a dose response relationship to nutrients and companions in mice  which guides future research about the role foods and friends may have in helping humans manage chronic pain   added dr hoots.
scientists have long suspected that feeling pain is connected to a person s mood or state of mind  but the link has never been proven beyond doubt.
this study supports that connection.
part of the pain is perception   said kalpna gupta  a visiting professor of medicine at uci and the study s lead author.
for instance  if i start watching a comedy  suddenly i might forget that i was hurting  mood and a feeling of well being block pain from being perceived.
sickle cell disease is a painful  lifelong condition that affects about 100 000 americans  according to the centers for disease control and prevention  the majority of whom are african american.
opioids are the most common method of treating their pain.
but because they re addictive  and overdoses are a leading cause of death in the united states  gupta s team has been investigating alternatives.
by suggesting a safe alternative to opioids for pain control  the findings of this study have the potential to change the practice of pain management and save lives   said study co author dr rajendra badgaiyan  a professor of psychiatry at the university of minnesota at the time who s now at the university of texas health science center in san antonio.
the researchers found that mouse models of sickle cell disease in a  happy environment  experienced less pain from the disorder.
over a four week period  the pain was reduced for male mice that were placed with female companions and received a diet rich in protein  fatty acids  and amino acids.
their pain decreased as the diet and companionship caused their brains to secrete serotonin.
researchers quantified the mice s pain according to the frequency with which they lifted their paws in response to stimuli and by their ability to exert force.
to confirm that serotonin caused the reduction in pain  the mice were given duloxetine  an antidepressant that works by raising the amount of serotonin in the brain.
the drug decreased pain levels for both male and female mice.
the researchers believe that adapting these conditions for humans would produce the same results.
gupta is recommending that duloxetine be used in clinical trials for sickle cell patients as an alternative to opioids for pain relief.
in the united states  the stigma associated with opioids can make it difficult for sickle cell patients to lessen their pain.
patients with sickle cell disease often have to navigate the complex social prejudices of the healthcare system in addition to dealing with severe pain   said varun sagi  a medical student at the university of minnesota and a contributing author on the study.
finding alternatives to opioids could help alleviate this burden.
duloxetine could provide an easier to obtain alternative.
likewise  as in the mice  building strong relationships and improving nutrition might also stimulate serotonin production in humans and thus reduce their pain.
as the covid 19 pandemic persists  social isolation can make relationship building a challenge  and as unemployment continues to hover around 7 per cent  many americans lack food security.
as the study suggests  this can impact pain for sickle cell patients and others  so gupta stressed the importance of developing strategies to enhance social interaction and nutrition for those affected.

"budget 2021 will go down in history for a number of firsts including the finance minister presenting the first digital budget and announcing that the eighth census of independent india will be the first digital census in the history of the country.
the finance minister allocated ₹3 768 crore for carrying out the census in budget 2021 22.
in many ways this announcement takes forward the push that the narendra modi government has been giving to digitalisation.
in september last year  home minister amit shah had announced that the 2021 census will be conducted through a mobile phone application  moving away from the traditional pen and paper to give digital india a boost.
the nationwide exercise will be carried out in 16 languages  the home minister had added.
the census will have its reference date as march 1 this year  but for jammu and kashmir  himachal pradesh and uttarakhand it will be october 1  last year  he had said.

pli will help achieve scale and job creation for the youth of india.
we look forward to the upcoming pli including the electronics industry sub sectors pcs  datacom  servers  wearables  telecom products  smart meters and components.
global research and development investment across all industrial sectors for 2020 is estimated to be in the order of  2.
4 trillion with an estimated increase of 2.
7 percent  or about  64 billion  over what was invested in 2019.
of this  about 24 percent is into electronics hardware and deep technology.
innovation and r d  which is one of the focus areas out of the six pillars for this budget  show that the government has its heart in the right place.
it is for the players to hear the ringing bells.
investment in r d is the need of the hour.
the fund allocation of rs.
3 lakh crores  which will focus on upgrading the infrastructure and technology of the discoms will help realize the country s vision to have 100 percent smart meters in three years.
this opportunity should be utilized by india to bring out indian design led and manufactured smart meters and the components that go into the manufacturing of smart meters  that will contain 80 percent  value addition of indian origin.
we are happy to see the continued emphasis on the adoption of technology into economic activities.
the national language translation mission  earlier proposed by meity  will enable bharat on the digital highway allowing the masses to take ride on the digitization of the economy.
the allocation of r d funds for development of digital payments technology and tools  the setting up of national digital educational architecture to bring about a digital first mindset in the activities of center and state/union territories are positive steps in this direction.
shibu paul  vice president   international sales  array networks    the fiscal deficit for 2020 21 was estimated at 9.
5 percent of gdp  the government s aim is to bring it down by 5 percent of the gdp by 2025 26  which is ambitious and certainly a welcoming initiative.
the highlight in this budget is the announcement of the asset reconstruction company and asset management company to help banks tackle bad loans  which have been a call by economists for many years.
the significance given to the investments and initiatives in the infrastructure development with a few coming under the ppp model will boost the overall development  which includes increased investment opportunity from various sectors.
the government s proposal to use data analytics  ai and ml for the ministry of corporate affairs  database is a boost to digitalization  where version 3.
0 of mca 21 includes additional modules for e scrutiny  e adjudication  e consultation and compliance management.
connecting more than 1 000 mandis into e nam is an excellent move.
setting up a separate administration structure for ease of doing business would help many organizations from various sectors.
the faceless dispute resolution panel would help the citizens by keeping them safe from tax harassment.
the importance given to healthcare sector to fight covid and any future healthcare issues  the stress made in green energy projects like keeping aside rs.
1 000 crores for solar energy and rs.
1 500 crores for renewable energy along with voluntary scrapping policy and the weightage given to education has made this budget wholesome.
v.
satish kumar  ceo  everestims technologies    the union budget 2021 augurs well for the economy and markets overall.
with the aggressive investment  monetization and recapitalization initiatives  the government is taking steps towards getting the economy back on track.
the focus on infrastructure  public transport and highways will see a jump starting of multiple tracks of the economy.
for the it sector  this will translate into an increase in projects  business and interventions that will be needed to support all these economic programs.
another good move for the it sector was that the tax holiday for start ups has been extended by one year and exemption on capital gains on investment in start ups extended by one year.
india has always been a resilient economy and these efforts will provide the elevation we need to take off and lead in the coming years.
dr.
keshab panda  ceo and md  l t technology services    the move to provide greater impetus to india s manufacturing sector with outlay of almost rs.

we are hopeful this will pave the way for enhanced adoption of digital engineering capabilities by domestic players  especially in the industry 4.

with patents and innovations being at the core of our proposition as a pure play engineering services provider  it was encouraging to know that innovation and r d was classified under the six pillars of focus for this year s union budget.
unlike last year where explicit mention to initiatives such as national mission on quantum computing and technology were announced  one would have hoped that this year s budget would have made provision for further focus.
rajendra chitale  cfo  crayon software experts india    it is a welcoming move that the government is emphasizing on the implementation of data analytics  artificial intelligence  ai  and machine learning  ml  for the ministry of corporate affairs   mca  database.

after the adversities of 2020  tax holiday for another year to startups is a commendable move by the government.
again  the tax audit bar raised to rs.
10 crores for those transacting 95 percent digitally shows the government s commitment towards bringing in greater transparency.
apart from that  the government s promise on removing gst anomalies and the amount of rs.
1 500 crores earmarked for a scheme to boost digital payments are other welcoming moves for a stronger digitized india.
gurpreet singh  managing director  arrow pc network pvt.
ltd.
regressive rules had certainly affected the ease of doing business for many organizations and start ups.
however  the government s announcement of establishing a separate administrative structure especially for ease of doing business will help many organizations benefit in the future.
revision of the definition of small companies by raising the capital base to rs.
2 crores from the current limit of rs.
50 lakh will give a big boost to companies affecting their monetary status.
though not much change has been made in terms of income tax slabs  the move to make changes in tax evasion has instilled confidence in common man that they would not be facing tax harassment.
earmarking rs.
1 500 crores for promoting digital mode of payment and changing the tax audit limit from rs.
5 crores to rs.
10 crores will benefit many and will allow transparency.
hiking of fdi from 49 percent to 74 percent is a good move.
the announcement that the forthcoming census would be digital shows the government s initiative to practice what is being preached.
on the other end  the emphasis on education  power and infrastructure sector will support the overall development of the nation.
sai srinivas  co founder and ceo  mobile premier league  mpl     the government s budget announcement has been extremely encouraging for the start up ecosystem in india.
the extended exemption on capital gains for investments will definitely make more funds available for budding entrepreneurs and growing organizations alike.
digital payments infrastructure has played a very important role in the growth of the mobile gaming industry.
it is very encouraging to see the government s efforts to strengthen digital payments through incentivization.
the rs.
1 500 crore boost will further support migration of more people towards digital payments and will have a positive impact on the mobile skill gaming industry.
the incentivizing of one person companies is especially heartening as it promotes the development of more game creators that will help in strengthening the gaming industry in india.
the move has also allowed conversion of one person companies to any other kind  reducing residency limit from 182 days to 120 days.
india is at the cusp of creating a wave of mobile gaming unicorns  these measures only support that momentum.
with these announcements acting as winds in our sails the indian gaming industry can aspire to be the global hub of game development.
prashanth gj  ceo  technobind    increased spend on healthcare and infra are welcome moves  as this will have a cascading effect on the economy in the medium term.
whether it is highways or railways  the enhanced allocation is very encouraging.
also interesting is the bad bank  which will help address the stressed assets through an arc model.
this will help keep the banking system insulated from the spike of bad loans that are expected now  thereby allowing them to do business as usual by giving the much needed support of credit in the system.
the msme allocation has been doubled  this too will help sme businesses in general  which is a big market for us in the country.
support for furthering the idea of digital india is also seen and it is very welcome  encouraging digital payments and the use of ai/ml in governance is exciting.
emphasis on digital payment is very good as this will go a long way in bringing in financial inclusion.
provisions in the gst and customs duty rationalization is something we look forward to.

हालाँकि इसके लिए कस्टमर्स को रिलायंस जियो का ही सिम यूज करना होगा.
बताया जा रहा है कि कंपनी सिर्फ़ वीवो ही नहीं  बल्कि दूसरी भारतीय स्मार्टफ़ोन मेकर्स  जैसे लावा और कार्बनसे भी बातचीत कर रही है.
इस रिपोर्ट में कहा गया है कि इन स्मार्टफोन्स की मैक्सिमम क़ीमत 8 000 रुपये तक हो सकती है.
रिपोर्ट में ये भी कहा गया है कि reliance jio ने चीनी हैंडसेट मेकर itel के साथ भी 4g हैंडसेट बनाने के लिए पार्टनरशिप कर रही है.

"no conversation about good heart health is ever complete without the mention of omega 3 fatty acids.
these healthy fats are known to reduce inflammation in the body  thus protecting your blood vessels from damage.
not to mention  they also reduce levels of triglycerides in the body  which are responsible for hardening the arteries.
there is no denying that omega 3 fatty acids are an essential part of a healthy lifestyle.
but did you know  they can also come to your rescue in the case of covid 19   get your daily dose of wellness subscribe to our newsletter  according to a study  people who have a higher omega 3 index have a lower probability of dying due to covid 19.
researchers with the fatty acid research institute  fari  and collaborators at cedars sinai medical center in los angeles and in orange county  ca  published the first direct evidence that higher omega 3 blood levels may reduce the risk for death from covid 19 infection.
the report was published in the journal ‘prostaglandins  leukotrienes and essential fatty acids’.
covid 19 and omega 3 fatty acids  what’s the link   there are several papers in medical literature hypothesizing that omega 3 fatty acids should have beneficial effects in patients with covid 19 infection  but up until now there have been no published peer reviewed studies supporting that hypothesis.
this study included a 100 patients admitted to the hospital with covid 19 for whom admission blood samples had been stored.
clinical outcomes for these patients were obtained and blood was analyzed for the omega 3 index  o3i  red blood cell membrane epa dha levels.
while not meeting standard statistical significance thresholds  this pilot study—along with multiple lines of evidence regarding the anti inflammatory effects of epa and dha—strongly suggests that these nutritionally available marine fatty acids may help reduce the risk for adverse outcomes in covid 19 patients.
larger studies are clearly needed to confirm these preliminary findings   said arash asher  md  the lead author on this study.
the researchers believe that an excessive inflammatory response  referred to as a ‘cytokine storm ’ is a fundamental mediator of severe covid 19 illness.
omega 3 fatty acids  dha and epa  have potent anti inflammatory activities  and this pilot study provides suggestive evidence that these fatty acids may dampen covid 19’s cytokine storm.

"agri and food companies on monday hailed the decision to hike farm credit target and increase allocation for the agriculture ministry in the budget  saying this will help in boosting farmers  income and overall growth of the sector.
asserting that the government is committed towards farmers  welfare  finance minister nirmala sitharaman on monday proposed 10 per cent hike in the farm loan disbursal target to rs 16.
5 lakh crore  and introduced an agri infra and development cess of up to 100 per cent to create post harvest infrastructure for improving farmers  income.
advertisement  the minister also proposed higher allocation for rural infrastructure development fund and micro irrigation fund  and extended agriculture infrastructure fund to apmcs for augmenting infrastructure facilities.
2020 has been a year of exceptional and unprecedented challenges and has highlighted the critical importance of two core sectors  agriculture and healthcare.
the union budget 2021 has correctly called out the role of these two sectors in leading the nation s recovery and being catalysts to sustainable growth    said d narain  senior bayer representative  south asia and ceo   md  bayer cropscience.
higher allocations for both healthcare and agriculture with specific focus on building public health infrastructure  expansion of credit to farmers  additional allocation for rural infrastructure and micro irrigation are welcome moves  he said.
these initiatives complement actions already initiated to double farmers  incomes and enabling wider healthcare access for the nation    narain added.
ram kaundinya  director general  federation of seed industry of india  fsii   said it is a status quo budget for agriculture in general and for seed industry in particular.
agriculture contributed significantly to our successful fight against covid.
but the sector did not get the needed attention in the budget.
no transformative measures have been proposed    he said.
on the positives  kaundinya said an increase in agricultural credit to rs 16.
5 lakh crore will help farmers in accessing more credit and rs 10 000 crore for micro irrigation is also a good measure.
increasing import duty on cotton is a good measure that should help in improving domestic prices although we are no longer a major cotton importer.
we are actually the largest exporter in the world  courtesy bt cotton driven increase in cotton production    he said.
output marketing related measures like extending enam  national agriculture market  to 1 000 more mandis and making agri infrastructure fund available for upgrading infrastructure in apmcs are welcome  fsii said.
on disappointments  kaundinya said investments in research in agriculture are not addressed  especially since research and innovation is one of the six pillars of aatmanirbhar bharat and there is a need to scale up private sector investments in agricultural research.
seed industry was expecting restoration of 200 per cent tax deduction of research expenses but it has not been met  he added.
the industry expected a major project to invest in scaling up domestic oilseeds production through incentives for farmers  use of modern technologies in crops like mustard  soybean and groundnut would be announced with an eye on reducing huge imports of edible oils  he said.
maithili appalwar  ceo  avana  said    the proposed outlay of rs 2.
87 lakh crore under the jal jeevan mission supports our vision of water conservation and sanitation.
with agriculture taking a centre stage in this year s budget  we appreciate the government s pragmatic measures of an influx of rs 10 000 crore as part of the micro irrigation corpus fund  a double since last fiscal.
announcement of the agriculture credit target of rs 16.
5 lakh crore for fy22  green scheme as well as an increase in provision to rural infra development fund to rs 40 000 crore from rs 30 000 crore will ensure the spur in development and growth for farmers  appalwar said.
asitava sen  ceo of croplife india  the apex body of agrochemical industries  said    the government s continued focus and commitment on doubling farmers  income by 2022 is very evident in the 2021 union budget.
with a view to reduce overall cost of production for farmers  he said the gst on agrochemicals could have been reduced from the current 18  to 12.
further  the government should provide 200  weighted deduction on r d expenses by agrochemical companies to encourage innovation and introduction of new technologies    sen said.

"the budget held some cheers for real estate developers  particularly those with affordable housing projects.
in a bid to increase the supply of affordable housing units  the finance minister announced extension of tax holiday up to march 2022.
this will encourage developers to launch new projects under this category.
according to real estate consultant anarock  affordable housing accounts for more than 35 per cent of the supply across the top seven cities in the country.
since the re opening of economy  this segment has seen higher demand from home buyers.
however  some of the other expectations of developers  including increasing the cap in the value  currently at ₹45 lakh  of an affordable housing unit  and infrastructure status for real estate industry  have not been met in the budget.
the realty sector has been witnessing steady recovery in its residential demand across categories — affordable housing  mid income and premium housing — since june last year.
the various measures announced by the centre since may last year have worked in favour of the developers.
the realty index  which includes companies with presence in affordable housing such as brigade enterprises and sunteck realty  has rallied 78 per cent since june last year to now.
according to a knight frank india real estate report  housing sales in the second half of last year  july to december  have declined 19 per cent compared to the same period in the previous year.
while housing sales are yet to recover to pre covid levels  between h1 2020 and h2 2020  sales have increased 60 per cent  particularly from affordable and mid income housing projects.
to maintain this momentum  the budget has given a boost to developers under section 80 iba.
currently  developers claim 100 per cent deduction of profits from affordable housing projects under this section.
the deduction is applicable only if these projects are approved during the period from june 1  2016  to march 31  2021.
now  this benefit has been extended up to march 31  2022.
this will benefit developers with focus on affordable housing projects  including brigade enterprises  sobha  sunteck realty and mahindra lifespaces.
given the off take in residential demand  these companies have fared better between april and december last year.
for instance  sobha  a bengaluru based realty player in mid income  affordable and luxury housing  reported increase in new sales  value  by 22 per cent y o y to ₹887.
6 crore during december quarter 2020.
a comfortable debt position too has helped these companies withstand challenging times.
further  under section 80 iba  the centre has also given 100 per cent deductions of profits and gains derived from the business of developing and building housing projects for rent.
on the other hand  if the centre had announced extension of credit linked subsidy scheme  clss  where centre provides subsidy for home loans taken by first time home buyers  for middle income group  it would have helped developers off load their unsold units faster.

about trevi therapeutics  inc.
trevi therapeutics  inc.
is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of haduvio to treat serious neurologically mediated conditions.
trevi is currently developing haduvio for the treatment of chronic pruritus  chronic cough in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  ipf  and levodopa induced dyskinesia  lid  in patients with parkinson’s disease.
these conditions share a common pathophysiology that is mediated through opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
trevi is currently conducting a phase 2b/3 clinical trial of haduvio  referred to as the prism trial  in patients with severe pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis and a phase 2 trial for chronic cough in patients with ipf.
founded in 2011  trevi therapeutics is headquartered in new haven  ct.
about haduvio  haduvio is an oral extended release formulation of nalbuphine.
nalbuphine is a mixed ĸ opioid receptor agonist and µ opioid receptor antagonist that has been approved and marketed as an injectable for pain indications for more than 20 years in the united states and europe.
the ĸ  and µ opioid receptors are known to be critical mediators of itch  cough and certain movement disorders.
nalbuphine’s mechanism of action also mitigates the risk of abuse associated with µ opioid agonists because it antagonizes  or blocks  µ opioid receptors.
nalbuphine is currently the only opioid approved for marketing that is not classified as a controlled substance in the united states and most of europe.
trevi intends to propose haduvio as the trade name for the nalbuphine er investigational product.

"new delhi the proposal to increase customs duty on certain imported automotive parts in the union budget 2020 21 will lead to increase in car prices  according to merecedes benz india and skoda auto volkswagen  even as component makers said the step will encourage local manufacturing of such items.
the government on monday proposed an increase in customs duty on certain imported components used in automobiles.
in the budget 2021 22  finance minister nirmala sitharaman proposed increase in customs duty of various parts  including ignition wiring sets  safety glass and parts of signalling equipment to 15 per cent with effect from february 2.
the parts would also attract agriculture infrastructure and development cess at the rate of 5 per cent.
currently  the parts attract customs duty in the range of 7.
5 10 per cent.
the increase in the rise in auto component duties is unexpected in such a revival period  and it will increase the production cost  leading to higher cost for consumers   mercedes benz india managing director and ceo martin schwenk said in a statement.
besides  there could have been further push towards e mobility by lowering import duties on electric vehicles  he added.
similarly  skoda auto volkswagen india managing director gurpratap boparai said the increase in customs duty on certain auto parts to 15 per cent will further increase input costs and prices for cars which depend on specialised components which cannot be manufactured locally due to unviable volumes.
it is important to keep in mind that even in the coming financial year  the passenger vehicle market is unlikely to reach the level of 2018 and the much required rationalisation of gst and cess to aid the auto industry was missing  he added.
both schwenk and boparai however welcomed the announcement of scrappage policy.
the government said the changes in basic customs duty is for creating level playing fields for the benefit of micro  small and medium enterprises  msmes  and other domestic manufacturers.
we are raising custom duty on certain auto parts to 15 per cent to bring them on par with the general rate of auto parts   sitharaman said in her budget speech.
automotive component manufacturers association president deepak jain said the increase in basic customs duty on select auto components will encourage local manufacturing of such items.
hailing the announcement of the scrappage policy  he noted that the announcements with regards increased spend on road infrastructure  voluntary scrappage policy  research and development and pli among others  augur well for the automotive sector.
similarly  federation of automobile dealers associations  fada  president vinkesh gulati said if 1990 is taken as a base year  there were around 37 lakh commercial vehicles and 52 lakh passenger vehicles eligible for voluntary scrapping.
we still need to see the fine prints to access the kind of incentives which will be on offer and thus have a positive effect on retail   he added.
hyundai motor india managing director  md  and chief executive officer  ceo  ss kim said the proposed vehicle scrappage policy will provide thrust towards procurement of new automobiles and have a strong positive effect giving a boost to atmanirbhar bharat.
tata motors ceo and md guenter butschek said voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and unfit vehicles  augmenting public transport system in urban areas  continuing focus on adoption of cleaner fuels  and enhancing outlays for developing road infrastructure are positive steps for the auto industry.
toyota kirloskar motor  tkm  vice chairman vikram kirloskar said the long awaited scrapping policy could contribute to lower fuel consumption  lessen pollution while also generating additional demand for cleaner new vehicles.
the auto sector welcomes this announcement and is hopeful that for realising full benefits there will be an early and full implementation of this policy   he added.
similarly  honda cars india senior vice president   director  marketing and sales  rajesh goel said the scrappage policy was one of the long awaited announcements for the auto sector.
expressing similar views  renault india operations country ceo and managing director venkatram mamillapalle said the policy will significantly reduce pollution and should help bolster demand for new vehicles in the commercial and passenger vehicle sectors.
mahindra   mahindra md and ceo pawan goenka said   though details are not yet out  when the policy comes out  it should have full incentive for scrapping and not just disincentive for not scrapping.
the union budget 2021 has several positive signals for the manufacturing sector and the commercial vehicles  cv  sector  which are core to the economy  ashok leyland md and ceo vipin sondhi said.
the rs 18 000 crore scheme to augment public transport in urban areas with the addition of 20 000 new buses in a ppp model would ensure cleaner and efficient public transportation and ease congestion  he added.
apollo tyres chairman onkar s kanwar also said the voluntary vehicle scrappage policy will provide the much needed fillip to the auto and tyre industry.
sitharaman on monday announced the much awaited voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and polluting vehicles.
presenting the budget for 2021 22 in parliament  sitharaman said that under voluntary vehicle scrapping policy  personal vehicles would undergo fitness tests after 20 years while commercial vehicles would require it after completion of 15 years.
road transport  highways and msmes minister nitin gadkari said the policy will lead to new investment of around rs 10 000 crore and create as many as 50 000 jobs.
he further said the policy would cover over 1 crore light  medium and heavy motor vehicles.

"to help ensure that all systems and components will operate reliably  automotive systems engineers require an advanced  automated tool for generating   verifying software code.
in today’s fast paced  high stakes design environment  engineering teams can no longer rely on outdated tools   processes for ensuring system integrity.
instead  they require a comprehensive simulation solution offered by an industry leader focused on helping customers bring better products to market faster.
this article by ansys – a global leader in engineering simulation – talks about the benefits gained if engineers relied on a customised tool created specifically for automotive systems design  how engineering automotive systems have become more challenging and the need to comply with increasingly complex   stringent standards for automotive electronics.
today’s automotive systems are more complex  smarter and autonomous than ever before  featuring functionality that no one could have imagined 10 years ago.
advanced sensors and electronics control everything  from a vehicle’s speed   position to its entertainment   communication technologies.
radar  cameras and other sophisticated electronics are increasingly being incorporated into consumer vehicles.
in fact  today  more than 60  of a car’s cost comes from its advanced electronics and software systems.
since many of the functions guided by electronic systems are mission critical  it’s essential that all automotive systems work together with complete reliability.
the tens of millions of lines of software code that control these systems must be flawless.
yet  this presents a challenge for automotive systems engineers  since many of the technology systems and components are sourced from different suppliers.
engineers are challenged with the critical task of creating a robust  failsafe system architecture  complete with controls that ensure the system’s consistent operation.
most automotive systems engineering teams rely on manual processes   generic tools  such as excel  to generate   verify this architecture.
because these tools are not created specifically for the task of automotive systems design  they do not support rapid or consistent engineering results.
the associated manual processes can be extremely time consuming and are subject to human error.
manual processes prove insufficient not only for initial systems design but also for ongoing tweaks and updates.
as changes are made in one component of the overall system  the entire electronics system architecture must be re engineered.
a single change must be verified against hundreds of other components and associated inputs to ensure that the integrity of the overall automotive system is maintained.
with incredible pressures in the automotive industry to innovate often and launch those innovations rapidly  engineers need a new solution to manage these complex systems engineering tasks.
in today’s fast paced  highly competitive industry landscape  they can no longer afford to rely on the tools   processes of the past.
advanced engineering requires advanced tools  the process of engineering an automotive system may be complex  but it is  in the end  a step by step process that can benefit from automation.
what’s needed is a new model based  automated solution that walks engineers through the various tasks involved in architecture design and verification.
in addition  as changes are made in one component  the ideal technology solution would automate the process of making any associated changes across the entire system — ensuring its continued safe  consistent operation.
by relying on an advanced technology tool to accomplish these tasks  automotive engineers could not only save time   money  they could also increase the accuracy and reliability of the resulting system.
if engineers relied on a customised tool created specifically for automotive systems design  they could realise these important benefits   an estimated 40  savings in costs associated with software code validation   verification activities  due to significant time savings   lower personnel needs  greater control over complex system architecture tasks  as the new model based tool would follow a proven  step by step approach  a higher level of system reliability  safety and security because the risk of human error would be minimised with the application of an advanced tool  a reduction in physical testing investments  since any flaws in software code would be identified   addressed at an early stage  a holistic approach that not only considers individual components but also how they are integrated with one another to form a complete system  simplifying even the most complex tasks  the ideal model based solution would be built specifically for the way automotive systems are engineered today.
it would be able to address a range of system designs  incorporating a broad range of components   connectivity.
via reduced ordered modelling and a step by step process  the new solution would accelerate the system engineering process without sacrificing the accuracy or robustness of verification activities.
with the emergence of radar   lidar technologies and autonomous driving  engineering automotive systems have become even more challenging.
any new software engineering solution would have to ensure the safe operation of a given car under a wide range of driving scenarios.
ideally  the new tool would also accommodate the different ways that engineering teams work together  integrating well with other common design tools and support processes.
in order to be as user friendly as possible for a variety of teams  the modelling solution should work across multiple platforms and languages  including sysml.
support for automotive industry standards  in 2003  a network of leaders in the worldwide automotive industry came together to create automotive open system architecture  autosar  — a set of standards that define an open software architecture for automotive electronics.
other relevant industry standards include iso 26262 and asam mcd2 dc.
any new software modelling solution must support these accepted industry standards to ensure that the resulting systems can be certified   approved.
engineering teams would benefit by developing overall software designs  interfaces and exchanges that work across multiple vehicle platforms and are accepted by multiple auto manufacturers.
the need to comply with increasingly complex and stringent standards for automotive electronics only emphasises the need for an advanced  customised modelling solution.
generic tools lack the intelligence to recognise and comply with industry standards  which means compliance must be managed manually.
by incorporating compliance into its underlying capabilities  a dedicated modelling solution would minimise human resource needs   time commitments  while maximising confidence that the final design will easily pass any regulatory approvals.
backed by a proven leader  to provide the greatest value — and the highest level of confidence — to automotive engineering teams  any new modelling solution should be developed by an industry leader.
the software developer should not only have a suite of proven products for software code generation and validation but also a long list of satisfied customers who have successfully applied its modelling solutions.
deep experience in generating   verifying control software code in related industries  including aviation  rail transportation and nuclear power  would instil confidence in automotive engineers.
the fact that similar software tools have been used successfully in more than 100 certified projects would help establish credibility among automotive engineering teams.
since system engineering is often closely coupled with other automotive engineering tasks  it would be best if the provider of the modelling solution offered a suite of related projects for automotive engineering applications.
not only would this ensure easy integration of solutions and seamless collaboration among various functions but it would also ensure that the model based tool is developed to work with the most common systems   technologies used by today’s engineering teams.
driving toward the future  a model based approach to automotive system designing promises a range of benefits  including a significant increase in the productivity of engineering staff.
as designers rely on an advanced tool to manage their code generation   verification tasks  new systems architectures can be launched much more rapidly.
just as automotive electronics capabilities have advanced rapidly  the solutions used to design electronics systems should also reflect the latest thinking and best in class technology.
already proven effective in mission critical applications  model based solutions for generating control software code should now be applied in the global automotive industry.
in the race to perfect autonomous vehicles  the new level of speed   efficiency enabled by such tools can help separate the leaders from the followers.
engineering simulation  while the idea of modelling software code for automotive systems is relatively new  engineering simulation has a long and successful history in other automotive applications.
computational fluid dynamics solutions from ansys allow engineers to simulate the external aerodynamics of cars  the combustion inside conventional engines and the flows associated with heating   cooling systems.
structural solutions  such as ansys mechanical  help engineers ensure design robustness  while also reducing weight   exploring alternative materials  such as composites.
with the introduction of scade solutions  customised for the automotive industry  ansys is leveraging its deep experience with the world’s leading automotive teams.
it is combining that expertise with the proven performance of scade modelling solutions in other sectors  including aviation  rail and nuclear power.
automotive customers can realise the best of both worlds as they apply scade solutions to their system architecture engineering tasks.
combining innovative features with the highest degree of confidence  systems engineering teams need to match the smart features of today’s cars with tools   processes that drive a more reliable  more efficient design process.
by leveraging a powerful solution that complies with the automotive industry standards — and is backed by an industry leader in control software design — engineers can emerge as leaders in developing cutting edge systems that combine innovative features with the highest possible degree of confidence.

well  anxiety is increasing to save the tax of those who get heavy salaries.
to save income tax   the taxpayer fulfills it through many types of investment.
many people do not save tax  tax  if they do not have the right information and employ the tax from their salary.
here we will tell you how you can save income tax for the home.
even if your annual income is up to rs 10.
50 lakh  then it will also be your tax zero  zero tax.
provided it will depend on how much loan you have taken.
since  when a person goes to work in a big city away from the house  it is a dream that in that place it will be an ashana.
now since he does not have much savings  he has to take a loan with a loan.
however  there has been no special relief on income tax in the budget  budget 2021   but a bigger announcement has been done about home loan  home loan.
after this announcement made by the government in the budget  if your annual salary is up to rs 10.
50 lakh  then you will not have to pay a rupee on it.
in the budget presented on 1 february 2021  finance minister nirmala sitaraman  nirmala sitharaman  has increased the deadline from march 31 to 2021 to 31 march 2022.
the government added section 80ea in budget 2019 for affordable housing.
at that time the deadline of this scheme was by march 2020.
in the budget 2020  its deadline was increased to march 2021.
once again its deadline has been extended for a year.
under this section  the annual rebate of 1.
5 lakh rupees is different in tax on the interest re payment of home loan.
this discount section is different from 24b.
under the section 24 b  there is a discount of rs 2 lakh in each financial year on the interest re payment of the home loan.
let us get the benefit of the deduction under section 80c on the principal amount re payment of home loans.
its limit is 1.
5 lakh rupees.
let s know how to calculate the tax on 10.
50 lakhs annual income   suppose someone s name is 10.
50 lakh rupees annually.
according to the old tax rule it comes in 30 per cent tax slab.
in the new tax rules  it comes in 20 percent tax slab.
well  there is no benefit of any kind of deduction in the new tax slab.
according to the old testament  the standard deduction of 50 thousand rupees will be available.
first  reduce its annual income from rs 10.
50 to rs 50000 for a standard did.
now the net income becomes 10 lakh rupees.
after this  under the section 80c  the principal emount re payment  principal amount repayment  has already provisioned by 1.
5 lakh rupees in 10.
50 lakhs.
now avoid 8.
50 lakh rupees.
under the section 24b  2 lakh discounts on interest re payment  then reduce rs 2.
0 lakh from rs 8.
50 lakh.
now its total income saves 6.
50 lakh rupees.
now a second section is given a discount of rs 1.
5 lakhs under 80ea.
now reduce 1.
5 lakh rupees from rs 6.
50 lakh.
after that  5.
0 lakh rupees  after this kind of calculation  after taking advantage of the deduction in the principal emount  principal amount  and interest re payount of the home loan  a net income remained 5 lakh rupees.
all of us know that the tax rate of annual income between 2.
5 lakh to 5.
0 lakh is 5 percent.
now at a rate of 5 per cent  tax liability is rs 12 500  but according to the rules of income tax  every taxpayer gets a rebate of 12  500 rupees.
in this way a total tax liability became zero.
but  here it is important to note that there are some conditions to take advantage of section 80ea.
if its benefits can only take the same people  then have purchased home for the first time.
the first condition to get the benefit of section 80ea is that the stamp value of the house should not be more than 45 lakhs.
for this  the carpet area should not be more than 60 squared meters or 645 square feet.
this condition is for metro cities  where there are countries like delhi  mumbai  bengaluru  noida  guram  hyderabad  kolkata.
carpet area for other cities may be 90 meters or 968 square feet.
at the same time  according to the old testament  the advantage of section 80ea will be found only when the real estate project has been approved before september 1  2019.
when the time limit has been increased when it has been increased  it is possible that the time limit should be increased.
there is no special information about the deadline of the real estate project.
it is worth mentioning that after taking the full advantage of section 24b to income tax donor  it can take advantage of section 80ee.

sap week will highlight the need for people with epilepsy to have a conversation with their healthcare providers  especially if they are in a key subgroup who would benefit from a seizure action plan like those who have intractable epilepsy syndromes  who are at high risk for seizure clusters  status epilepticus or have frequent nocturnal generalized tonic clonic seizures   said dr.
tracy dixon salazar  lgs foundation executive director.
sap awareness week features a social media campaign and new website designed to highlight the need for people with epilepsy  their caregivers and healthcare providers to develop detailed plans  especially should an emergency occur.
the social media campaign incorporates the hashtag  sapaw2021 and urges people to learn more at seizureactionplans.
org.
according to the centers for disease control and prevention  approximately 3.
5 million americans have epilepsy  which is roughly 3 million adults and 470 000 children and teens   explained  executive director  dravet syndrome foundation.
about one third of people with epilepsy will eventually develop refractory epilepsy or drug resistant epilepsy  making a seizure action plan an important management tool  so this new awareness week is critical for educating the epilepsy community about this important issue.
a seizure rescue plan is a critical component in the overall management of seizure emergencies   said  president and chief executive officer of neurelis  inc.
we are excited to see the launch of this website as an important new resource that will benefit people living with epilepsy and those who care for them.
in addition  the launch of seizure action plan awareness week helps spotlight the important need for everyone with epilepsy to have a thoughtful and comprehensive seizure action plan.
it is our privilege to partner in this effort and many other initiatives in the epilepsy community.
in a recent study  only 30  of adult patients responded that they have a seizure action plan  and only 45  of pediatric patients had a seizure action plan.
a seizure action plan can offer more control to patients and caregivers by providing consistent  patient specific guidance regarding seizure management.
a seizure action plan can also provide clarification on patient and caregiver concerns  such as understanding what to do during a seizure  when watchful waiting is appropriate  when to call 911 or go to the hospital  and much more   shared  president and ceo  tuberous sclerosis alliance.
we ve heard from people living with epilepsy  their caregivers  and physicians that a seizure action plan can make the difference in the day to day  lived experience of a person living with a seizure disorder   said  head of u.
s.
neurology  ucb.
we are proud to support this important education to ensure that people living with epilepsy have the tools and medications they need  and we are committed to developing rescue treatments to stop seizure clusters when and where they occur as well as to rapidly terminate active epileptic seizures.
all adults and children with epilepsy need a seizure action plan  especially those with new onset epilepsy and those with ongoing frequent convulsive seizures who had more than one seizure in the previous year.
seizure free patients who have risk factors for breakthrough seizures may also benefit from a seizure action plan.
in addition  those who need help to identify their individual seizure pattern  do not have a plan  or live far from medical facilities are key subgroups who would benefit from a seizure action plan.

60 लाख करोड़ रुपए का आर्थिक नुकसान हुआ है। फिलहाल देश में करीब 14 करोड़ लोग खराब हवा में सांस लेने को मजबूर हैं। दुनिया के 20 सबसे प्रदूषित शहरों में 13 भारत में ही हैं। ऐसे में खराब हवा स्वस्थ लोगों को भी बीमार बना रही है और पहले से बीमार लोगों के लिए जानलेवा बन रही है।  वायु प्रदूषण से होने वाली बीमारियां कौन सी हैं   एम्स  aiims  दिल्ली में रुमेटोलॉजी डिपार्टमेंट की हेड डॉक्टर उमा कुमार कहती हैं। वायु प्रदूषण से सभी तरह की नॉन कम्युनिकेबल डिजीज का खतरा होता है। हार्ट  कार्डियो वैस्कुलर  ऑटो इम्युन डिजीज का भी सबसे ज्यादा खतरा होता है।  हाल ही में ब्रिटेन में हुई एक स्टडी के मुताबिक एयर पॉल्यूशन ज्यादा होने से कोरोना होने की आशंका बढ़ जाती है। एयर पॉल्यूशन की वजह से ओजोन की लेअर डैमेज हो रही है। इसका सीधा संबंध अल्ट्रा वॉयलट किरणों से है। वहीं  इससे शरीर में विटामिन d की कमी भी हो सकती है।  प्रदूषण से हुई मौतों के मायने क्या हैं   icmr की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक  इंडोर वायु प्रदूषण से होने वाली मौतों में 1990 से 2019 तक 64  की कमी आई है। लेकिन  आउटडोर हवा में मौजूद प्रदूषण से होने वाली मौतों में 115  का इजाफा हुआ है।  वायु प्रदूषण किस बीमारी के लिए कितना जिम्मेदार   icmr के महानिदेशक बलराम भार्गव ने बताया कि अध्ययन के नतीजे बताते हैं कि वायु प्रदूषण फेंफड़ों से जुड़ी बीमारियों के 40  मामलों के लिए जिम्मेदार है।  हार्ट डिजीज  स्ट्रोक  डायबिटीज और समय से पहले पैदा होने वाले नवजात बच्चों की मौत के लिए वायु प्रदूषण 60  तक जिम्मेदार है।  रिपोर्ट में कहा गया है कि यदि वायु प्रदूषण रोकने के लिए सही उपाय नहीं किए  तो भारत को बड़ा खामियाजा उठाना पड़ेगा।  वायु प्रदूषण से होने वाली मौतें  बीमारियां और आर्थिक नुकसान की वजह से भारत का 2024 तक 5 ट्रिलियन डॉलर की अर्थव्यवस्था बनने का सपना भी टूट सकता है।  इस रिपोर्ट से सीखने वाली 3 अहम बातें क्या हैं   वायु प्रदूषण के खतरों के प्रति जागरुकता की जरूरत है। सरकार को वायु प्रदूषण रोकने के लिए बड़े और कड़े कदम उठाने होंगे। आम लोगों से भी प्रदूषण रोकने में सहयोग की दरकार होगी।  वायु प्रदूषण में सबसे अहम रोल किन चीजों का है   डॉक्टर उमा कहती है कि वायु प्रदूषण में सबसे बड़ा रोल गाड़ियों से होने वाले पॉल्यूशन का होता है। गाड़ियों से निकलने वाला धुंआ और उड़ने वाली धूल दोनों सेहत के नुकसानदायक हैं। हमने कुछ समय पहले एक स्टडी की थी। उसमें पाया था कि जिनका घर सड़क से जितना ज्यादा करीब होता है  उन लोगों में ऑटो इम्युन डिजीज का खतरा उतना ज्यादा होता है। इसे हमने सरोगेट पॉल्यूशन नाम दिया। इसलिए हमारी कोशिश होनी चाहिए कि घर मुख्य सड़क से दूर खरीदें।  इसके अलावा एयर पॉल्यूशन सिर्फ आउटडोर ही नहीं  इनडोर होता है। दोनों पॉल्यूशन बराबर तौर पर सेहत के लिए खतरनाक हैं। इंडोर पॉल्यूशन से बचने के लिए आप एयर प्यूरीफायर भी लगवा सकते हैं  यह प्रदूषण को कम करने में थोड़ा बहुत मददगार है।  टोबेको पॉल्यूशन एयर पॉल्यूशन से भी ज्यादा खतरनाक  एम्स दिल्ली में डीएम कार्डियोलॉजिस्ट डॉक्टर संजय कुमार चुघ कहते हैं टोबेको पॉल्यूशन  एयर पॉल्यूशन से भी ज्यादा खतरनाक हैं। इसके अलावा वॉटर  फूड  नॉइज पॉल्यूशन भी बहुत खतरनाक हैं। इसलिए हमें एयर के साथ बाकी पॉल्यूशन से भी दूर रहना चाहिए।  एयर पॉल्यूशन सांस के मरीजों के बहुत ज्यादा खतरनाक है। हवा में प्रदूषण होने से ऑक्सीजन का लेवल कम हो जाता है। इसके चलते थकान लगती है और काम करने की क्षमता में भी कमी आती है।  क्या भारतीय कानून हमें प्रदूषण से बचा सकते हैं   भारत में वायु प्रदूषण की रोकथाम के लिए साल 1981 में एक एयर एक्ट लागू किया गया था  लेकिन पिछले 40 साल में इस कानून के तहत दर्ज किए गए मुकदमों की संख्या न के बराबर है। वहीं इन 40 सालों में भारतीय शहरों में वायु प्रदूषण गंभीर स्तर पर पहुंच चुका है।",fresh air is essential  air pollution is also dead from corona  very threat to diseases  whose home road
"zee business हिंदी द्वारा प्रदत्त  epfo  take home salary  अगर श्रम मंत्रालय  labour ministry  के सुझावों को मान लिया गया तो नौकरीपेशा लोगों की take home salary बढ़ सकती है.
दरअसल नए wage code के बाद ये कहा जा रहा है कि कर्मचारियों की टेक होम सैलरी घट जाएगी  लेकिन ग्रेच्युटी और पेंशन में बढ़ोतरी होगी.
ऐसे में ये खबर उन कर्मचारियों को राहत दे सकती है जो अपनी take home salary में कटौती नहीं चाहते.
नया वेतनमान के नियम अप्रैल से लागू हो सकते हैं.
epf अंशदान घटाने की सिफारिश  recommendation to reduce epf contribution   दरअसल  श्रम मंत्रालय ने संसदीय समिति को कर्मचारी भविष्य निधि  epf  में कर्मचारी और इम्पलॉयर  दोनों का अंशदान 12 परसेंट से घटाकर 10 परसेंट करने का सुझाव दिया है.
इससे कर्मचारियों की सैलरी में बढ़ोतरी हो जाएगी.
लेकिन पीएफ में योगदान कम होने से पेंशन की राशि कम हो जाएगी.
बढ़ जाएगी पेंशन  ग्रेच्युटी  pension  gratuity will increase   आमतौर पर अभी ज्यादातर कंपनियां कर्मचारी की सैलरी का गैर भत्ता हिस्सा  non allowance part  50 परसेंट से कम रखती हैं  जिससे वो उन्हें epf और ग्रेच्युटी में कम योगदान करना पड़े.
लेकिन नया वेतन कोड लागू होने के बाद कंपनियों को बेसिक सैलरी बढ़ानी पड़ेगी.
इससे कर्मचारियों की take home salary तो घट जाएगी  लेकिन pf योगदान और ग्रेच्युटी योगदान बढ़ जाएगा.
साथ ही कर्मचारी की टैक्स tax liability भी घट जाएगी  क्योंकि कंपनी कर्मचारी के लिए अपना pf योगदान उसके ctc  cost to company  में जोड़ देगी.
नए वेतनमान नियम में घटेगी सैलरी  salary will reduced in new pay scale   दरअसल  इस साल अप्रैल 2021 से निजी कंपनियों में काम करने वाले कर्मचारियों की टेक होम सैलरी  take home salary  घट सकती है  क्योंकि कंपनियों को नए वेतन नियम  new wage rules  के हिसाब से कर्मचारियों के सैलरी स्ट्रक्चर में बदलाव करना होगा.
नए वेतन नियमों के मुताबिक  किसी भी कर्मचारी के भत्ते  allowances  कुल भुगतान  compensation  का 50 परसेंट से ज्यादा नहीं हो सकते हैं.
मतलब अप्रैल  2021 से कर्मचारी की बेसिक सैलरी  basic pay  कुल सैलरी  total pay  का 50 परशेंट या इससे ज्यादा होगी.
जितना pf योगदान  उतनी ही पेंशन  the more pf contribution  the more pension   लेकिन श्रम मंत्रालय ने एक और सुझाव संसदीय समिति को दिया है  श्रम मंत्रालय का कहना है कि ईपीएफओ  epfo  जैसे पेंशन फंड को आगे जारी रखने और ज्यादा व्यावहारिक बनाए रखने के लिए मौजूदा ढांचे में बदलाव करना होगा.
इसमें  defined benefits  के बजाय  defined contributions  का सिस्टम लागू किया जाए.
अभी epfo पेंशन की न्यूनतम सीमा तय है  यह एक तरीक से ‘defined benefits’ मॉडल है.
defined contributions सिस्टम को अपनाने पर पीएफ सदस्यों को उनके अंशदान के मुताबिक बेनेफिट मिलेगा  यानी जितना योगदान उतना ही फायदा.
सुझावों पर फैसला होना बाकी  suggestions to be decided   अगर नए वेतनमान नियमों को ध्यान में रखकर इस सुझाव को देखें तो उन कर्मचारियों के लिए राहत की खबर है जो अपनी टेक होम सैलरी ज्यादा चाहते हैं.
हालांकि इस पर अभी कोई फैसला नहीं लिया गया है.

"eds  adds quotes   chandigarh  feb 1  pti  punjab chief minister amarinder singh on monday flayed the union budget  saying it reflects the centre’s  persistent efforts to sideline  non bjp ruled states.
the shiromani akali dal and the aam aadmi party too dubbed the budget as  anti common man   accusing the centre of selling off national assets to corporates.
the reactions came hours after finance minister nirmala sitharaman presented the union budget for 2021 22.
the punjab cm claimed that the budget was  reflective of the bjp led central government s apathy towards the common man  the middle class and farmers.
he criticised the centre for the  stepmotherly  treatment meted out to punjab and other northern states  claiming that it was  designed  to cater to the poll bound states of west bengal and south india with a massive infrastructure development allocation for these regions.
the budget also manifests the central government s persistent efforts to sideline non bjp states like ours  as well as its anti federal mindset   said the cm  pointing to the gap between the fiscal deficit targets fixed for the union government and states.
the punjab cm claimed the concerns of the defence sector have not been adequately addressed despite a growing border threat from china and pakistan.
trashing the centre s claim that the health sector allotment has been increased by 35 per cent  the cm said the fact is the numbers have been  fudged  to project a hike by including the rs 35 000 crore allocated for covid 19 vaccine and the amount set aside for sanitation under the health head.
actually  the budget for health is down by 10 per cent  he added.
and did the finance minister not find it necessary to even mention constitutional guarantee for the msp  one of the key demands of the farmers battling cold and lathis on the doorstep of new delhi for over two months now   the punjab cm asked.
punjab finance minister manpreet singh badal too said the budget was silent on agricultural unrest  unemployment and problems of the middle class.
in a series of tweets  badal claimed that the  entire north india  was ignored in the budget.
the budget is silent on agricultural unrest.
it buries its head in the sand  and rather than help solve the crisis that the nda created.
what about msp   badal asked in a tweet.
the punjab minister claimed that instead of doubling income from agriculture  it will reduce the earnings by half.
badal further said that the budget was  silent  on unemployment caused by the nda government s coronavirus  mismanagement.
he claimed that the budget was  silent on the travails of the middle class.
middle classes get nothing except increased costs of petrol and diesel.
hopes of the middle classes of relief after suffering from a once in a century pandemic have been shattered   he said in another tweet.
entire north india has been ignored.
why  because it is not going to the polls  states that are going to polls are given sops.
just like the maximum padma awardees came from five states going to polls   badal claimed.
badal further alleged   the budget seeks to sell india s precious assets.
later in the day he told the media said they expected more allocation for agriculture  banking  health and defence sectors.
as far agriculture is concerned  badal said there was only two per cent hike in the allocation for the sector.
meanwhile  the shiromani akali dal and the aam aadmi party said the budget was against the common man.
sad president sukhbir singh badal accused the the bjp led union government of  selling off national assets to its corporate friends.
the budget had also punished punjabis for supporting the peaceful agitation against the centre’s agricultural laws  he said in a statement here.
badal said at a time when there is a need to increase direct benefit transfers to farmers and under privileged sections  the centre is focusing on disinvesting public sector undertakings  psus.
this will give a further boost to crony capitalism as corporate players are set to buy these psus at cheap prices   the sad chief added.
the aam aadmi party  aap  termed the budget as  anti people and anti punjab.
aap leader and the leader of opposition in the punjab assembly  harpal singh cheema  said the provisions in the budget will increase people’s problems and benefit only friends of prime minister narendra modi.
cheema said the budget made a provision of levying cess on diesel and petrol  which are used by farmers.
he said there was nothing for employment generation in it and punjab was completely ignored.
it is clear that the centre is discriminating against punjab   he alleged.
meanwhile  bjp national general secretary tarun chugh hailed the budget as a  big step towards reassuring farmers  that the modi government will continue to give top priority to their welfare.
a remarkable increase in the disbursement of procurement money to farmers for wheat and paddy crops testified that the centre would continue to strengthen the msp system  he said in a statement.

"new delhi  feb 1  pti  the railways operating ratio is expected to improve to 96.
96 per cent by the end of the current financial year despite coronavirus related disruptions  railway board member naresh salecha said on monday.
the operating ratio means expenses as a portion of revenue or the amount spent on every rupee earned.
salecha said as far as the finance of indian railways is concerned  its operating ratio was pegged at 96.
15 per cent for 2020 21.
this is lower than the revised estimate of 98.
36 per cent for 2019 20.
a lower operating ratio can be attributed to lower expenditure on account of a fall in working expenses as well as a sharp decline in pension liabilities.
pension liability was budgeted at rs 53 160 crore in the beginning of the current fiscal.
however  the revised estimate stood at rs 523 crore as the national transporter made an arrangement with the finance ministry to defer this expense   he said.
the railway board member noted that 2020 was an  extraordinary  and  exceptional  year due to coronavirus pandemic as a result of which passenger trains did not run.
our projections hence went haywire.
before this  we have been taking full pension liabilities.
when we could not meet such liabilities  we came to an arrangement with the finance ministry so that a separate fund could be given to us  which we have to repay to the ministry.
in a couple of years  we have to pay it back   he said.

"finance minister nirmala sitharaman seems to have presented the union budget 2021 22 with an aim to give fillip to the indian government s disinvestment agenda.
she announced several policy measures  including privatisation of two banks and one general insurance company along with asset monetisation to ensure government has enough money to push for economic growth.
union budget 2021 22 reaffirms that the narendra modi government s philosophy that  it is not the government s business to be in business.
presenting her third budget today  sitharaman estimated rs 1 75 000 crore as disinvestment receipts for 2021 22  which is much lower than last year s disinvestment budget target of rs 2.
1 lakh crore.
notably  last year s disinvestment receipts dropped down severely to less than 6.
5 times  rs 32 000 crore.
she added that government plans to complete sale of bpcl  air india  shipping corporation of india  container corporation of india  idbi bank  beml  pawan hans  neelachal ispat nigam limited among others in next fiscal.
outlining the modi government s privatisation policy  sitharaman said   four areas that are strategic where bare minimum cpses will be maintained and rest privatized.
in the remaining sectors all cpses will be privatized.
the government will keep presence through public sector companies only in atomic energy  space and defence  transport and telecommunications  power  petroleum  coal and other minerals and banking  insurance and financial services.
rest all psus will be privatised or sold.
the modi government s roadmap is now clear.
former finance secretary and economic affairs secretary subhash chandra garg says  privatisation is a kind of disinvestment.
disinvestment can be strategic where you can sale and pass on the management control or disinvestment can be small bit of shares where you retain the management control and ownership with you.
he explained that it is possible to sell bank on strategic basis.
you may decide to sell your entire share holding or you may decide to sell a little less than but pass on the strategic control to the buyer.
there is complete possibility of privatisation of public sector bank but it would require some changes in law as currently the banking regulation acts and nationalisation banking acts don t permit it.
that would require amendment in law.
garg said which banks are on government s radar  would reveal the government s stand.
if you privatise smaller unhealthy banks like indian overseas bank or some other bank  it may not be such a big deal.
if you do a better bank like canara bank  bank of baroda kind of banks then it will be real good privatisation   he added.
earlier in 2003 04  the government had disinvested strategically balco  hindustan zinc  and a couple of itdc hotels.
sitharaman said   idle assets will not contribute to atmanirbhar bharat.
the non core assets largely consist of surplus land with government ministries/departments and public sector enterprises.
monetising of land can either be by way of direct sale or concession or by similar means.
this requires special abilities and for this purpose  i propose to use a special purpose vehicle in the form of a company that would carry out this activity.
the national highways authority of india  nhai  undertook the indian government s first attempt for asset monetisation.
it outsourced tot  toll operate transfer  of nine national highways that fetched the government rs 9 681 crore as upfront payment.
the project was won by sydney based macquarie group.
that experience came handy as the government now aims to launch a  national monetization pipeline  of potential brownfield infrastructure assets along with a dashboard.
this will provide visibility to investors.
these would include national highways  dedicated freight corridor and next lot of airports.
notably in 2019  international monetary fund  imf  had stated that the total public sector assets in 38 countries are worth us   103 trillion or 216 per cent of gdp.
the imf blog  a global picture of public wealth  had also these assets consist of public infrastructure such as bridges and roads  financial assets such as bank deposits  as well as natural resource reserves in the ground.
the idea behind this was to make governments know more about what you own and owe is to better assess fiscal risks and evaluate government policies.
it seems the indian government has taken a cue from it.
arvind sharma  partner  shardul amarchand mangaldas and company  said   the government will have to ensure that acquisition of government enterprises should make business sense.
innovative structures will have to be adapted to deal with employee unions and labour matters  lesser continuing or transitioning obligations and incentives which are immediately discontinued after disinvestments.
there are some very good assets in the government s portfolio  and they can be encashed fruitfully and at the same time interests of various stakeholders can be advanced.
since at the end of the day it is sale of a business  so legacies should not be imposed as they do not make commercial sense.

"hc ask if amazon  future open to resolve issue relating to reliance deal   photo credit  ians  new delhi  the delhi high court monday sought to know whether us based e commerce giant amazon and kishore biyani led future retail ltd  frl  were open to resolving the issue arising out of rs 24 713 crore deal between frl and reliance retail.
the counsel for both  amazon and future group  submitted that they would seek instructions and inform the court on tuesday.
the court was hearing a plea by amazon seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by singapore s emergency arbitrator  ea  restraining frl from going ahead with its rs 24 713 crore deal with reliance retail.
amazon.
com nv investment holdings llc  in its plea  also sought detention of the biyanis  directors of future coupons pvt ltd  fcpl  and frl and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged  wilful disobedience  of the emergency arbitrator s order.
justice j r midha asked the parties to inform it on tuesday if any such endeavour could be made and clarified that this should not be taken as deferring the proceedings and it would continue as scheduled.
the court  which asked if any attempt has been made to resolve the issue  suggested that if parties would be willing  it can refer the matter to two retired judges of the supreme court.
the court also said it will consider whatever protective order can be passed.
in commercial matters  it is always helpful to find a solution  it said.
to this  senior advocate gopal subramanium  representing amazon  said he will take instructions on it as nothing tangible has happened.
senior advocate darius khambata  representing frl  also said he will take instructions and inform the court.
amazon has approached the high court seeking to restrain kishore biyani led future group from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the mukesh dhirubhai ambani  mda  group.
it also sought to restrain future group from taking any steps to transfer or dispose of frl s retail assets or the shares held in frl by the biyanis in any manner without prior written consent of amazon.
the future group and amazon have been locked in a battle after the us based company took frl into the emergency arbitration over alleged breach of a contract between them.
the three domestic firms    frl  fcpl and reliance    have however contended before the high court that if amazon s claim    that it indirectly invested in frl by investing in fcl    was accepted then it would amount to a violation of indian foreign direct investment laws which permit only 10 per cent investment by a foreign entity in the multi brand retail sector.
according to amazon  the ea award passed under the singapore international arbitration centre  siac  rules is enforceable under section 17 2  of the arbitration and conciliation act.
it referred to an order passed by the high court on december 21  2020  prima facie holding that the ea s award was valid under the indian law.
senior advocate harish salve  also representing frl  had earlier submitted that amazon had a deal with fcpl and signed an agreement with biyani.
fcpl has a shareholding agreement with frl which has no agreement with amazon.
subramanium had urged that frl shall not further precipitate the situation as the matter is being heard by the court.
in the petition  amazon has alleged that future group  kishore biyani and other promoters and directors have  deliberately and maliciously disobeyed the ea award despite it being binding on them and not having challenged it in accordance with the law.
the majority respondents  action of simply ignoring the order  of ea  and continuing with the impugned transaction  deal  is not only contumacious but calls into serious question their respect for enforceability of contracts  the rule of law and the administration of justice.
.
it said.
it sought to injunct future group and its officials from taking any steps in furtherance of the deal with reliance.
in august last year  future had reached an agreement to sell its retail  wholesale  logistics and warehousing units to reliance.
the siac on october 25 last year  had passed an interim order in favour of amazon barring frl from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.
subsequently  amazon wrote to market regulator sebi  stock exchanges and competition commission of india  cci   urging them to take into consideration the singapore arbitrator s interim decision as it is a binding order  frl had earlier told the high court.
as per the siac interim order  a three member arbitration panel needs to be set up within 90 days  from the date of the judgement  with one judge each being appointed by future and amazon  along with a third neutral judge.
on november 10  2020  amazon had told the court that it and fcl have appointed their respective arbitrators.

unveiling the much awaited strategic disinvestment policy  finance minister nirmala sitharaman said four broad sectors are classified as strategic in which at least one psu is to be retained while the remaining ones can be privatised or merged or closed.
these sectors are  atomic energy  space and defence  transport and telecommunications  power  petroleum  coal and other minerals  banking  insurance and financial services.

the new policy will release a large number of psus for privatisation in the coming years  potentially boosting the centre’s non debt capital receipts for various social sector and developmental programmes.

"the guardian  the men – plus one teenager living overseas – were targeted for allegedly posting ‘defamatory’ material about soldiers who died in clashes last year chinese and indian troops clashed along the disputed border between the two countries in june.
beijing admitted for the first time this week that four of its soldiers died in the clashes.
photograph  anonymous/ap chinese authorities have arrested at least six people  and is targeting a teenager living overseas  for posting online about chinese soldiers killed in a border clash last year.
last week the chinese government bestowed posthumous honours on four soldiers who died after the galwan valley clash with indian forces  in the disputed himalayan border regions.
the men were detained under a 2018 law which makes it illegal to defame  heroes and martyrs  in china.
an amendment set to take effect this month brings potential penalties of three years in jail.
another man who police said had lived overseas since july 2019  was  pursued online  over comments he made about the soldiers   on suspicion of causing trouble on the internet.
in a statement police in chongqing city said the 19 year old man  surnamed wang and posting on weibo as  tscb8  had  slandered and belittled the heroes  with his comments   causing negative social impact.
heroes and martyrs are not allowed to be desecrated.
cyberspace is not outside the law   it said.
public security organs will crack down on acts that openly insult the deeds and spirit of heroes and martyrs in accordance with the law.
the others  who were arrested or turned themselves in  were aged between 20 and 40.
four were accused of committing crimes on weibo and wechat and ordered into criminal detention for up to 15 days.
others were held in administrative detention  one of china’s many forms of detaining suspects and which has been criticised by rights groups in the past.
one man is nanjing blogger  qiu ziming  who reportedly questioned the official death toll given by chinese authorities  and the eight month timeline before an official announcement.
indian officials said at the time they believed around 45 chinese soldiers had died.
qui was suspected of  picking quarrels and causing trouble   a broadly defined crime which carries 10 years in jail  and is often used against journalists and activists.
qiu’s weibo account  which had more than 2.
5 million followers  has since been suspended.
yaqui wang  china researcher for human rights watch  said the pursuit of the 19 year old was a tactic by authorities  to show that they would not tolerate any speech questioning the official narrative of the border conflict  no matter where the critic is physically located.
authorities used to harass overseas based critics or their china based families without resorting to formal prosecution mechanism or leaving a paper trail   wang told the guardian.
now they don’t feel they need to be discreet about it  or maybe they even want to be conspicuous about it.
the honouring of the chinese soldiers was the first time china has officially confirmed any deaths from the violent conflict  which saw hand to hand combat between hundreds of indian and chinese soldiers on a narrow himalayan ridge  using spiked clubs and rocks as weapons.
it as the deadliest conflict between the two sides in 40 years.
images of the chinese soldiers and patriotic quotes attributed to them blanketed state media last week  and some video was released of the confrontation at the river  including several injured soldiers.
the reports were trending topics in china over the weekend  drawing millions of posts and comments from the public  including under the hashtag  they died for me.
both india and china announced they were pulling their troops back from their disputed border on 11 february.
china’s defence ministry said in a statement that both sides had started a  synchronised and organised  disengagement.
the tense standoff high in the karakoram mountains began in early may when indian officials said chinese soldiers crossed the frontier at three different points in the indian state of ladakh  erecting tents and guard posts and ignoring verbal warnings to leave.
that triggered shouting matches  stone throwing and fistfights  much of it replayed on television news channels and social media.
tensions exploded into hand to hand combat with clubs  stones and fists on 15 june that left 20 indian soldiers dead.

"in her speech  finance minister nirmala sitharaman pegged total government expenditure for the current fiscal year at ₹34.
5 trillion   472 billion.
that’s  57 billion more than what analysts had forecast based on a muted april to november trend  extrapolated for a bump in december through march  the final four months of the accounting period.
but not only is sitharaman spending much more liberally than expected  she wants to loosen her purse strings by another  5 billion in the next fiscal year.
the equity market is happy for four main reasons.
one  there was no major new tax — or an increase in tax rates — to meet the spending goal.
two  even as total outlay goes up by  5 billion  the capital expenditure part  which could create new orders and profit for india inc.
is projected to rise by  15 billion.
third  the finance minister’s promise of a bad bank to take away commercial lenders’ soured assets is giving the market hope that clogged up credit will start to flow more freely.
the government is also setting up a new  development  financial institution to meet the needs of the infrastructure sector.
finally  the decision to allow foreign insurers to boost their stakes in local joint ventures to 74  from 49  is a welcome reform.
the bond investor  meanwhile  is nursing a rude sticker price shock.
the finance minister said the current fiscal year’s budget deficit would be as wide as 9.
5  of gross domestic product  about 2 percentage points more than the consensus estimate.
in the coming year  she wants to trim the shortfall  but not too drastically.
a targeted deficit of 6.
8  of gdp will require new delhi to borrow aggressively once again  both from the bond market and from citizens’ small savings pool.
all eyes are on the central bank.
given that the reserve bank also intends to buy the dollars flooding into india’s stock market to keep the rupee from rising too much  there’s a limit on how many government bonds it may purchase from banks.
india wants to spend its way to a v shaped recovery and hoping that getting there would also ease the resource crunch.
for instance  next year’s budget assumes a 17  jump in tax revenue and a more than five fold jump in state asset sales.
with the spread of the virus contained — and inoculation expected to gather pace — these targets may not be as daunting as they appear.
even then  a lot has to go right for financing issues to not raise their head during the year  especially if the u.
s.
federal reserve decides to start tapering its asset purchases  raising borrowing costs for emerging markets.
this leaves india with very little time to steady an economy that was slowing precipitously even before covid 19.
disturbingly  india’s protectionist turn — under the garb of self reliance — continued in the budget  with import tariffs going up on auto components and mobile phone parts.
this doesn’t augur well for manufacturing  especially for smaller firms whose revival holds the key to employment.
after they fled locked down urban centers  60 million migrant workers — equivalent to italy’s population — found a halfway house in india’s rural job guarantee last june.
while demand for publicly funded low wage jobs has since ebbed to 34 million  a fifth of indians who lost their services  manufacturing and construction jobs are still working as farmhands or are unemployed.
still  the pandemic has finally alerted india to some long neglected priorities  even after taking away the cost of vaccination  the  30 billion earmarked for health and wellbeing is a doubling of the pre covid 19 spending level.
what remains to be seen is whether this money can actually be spent.
overall  too  execution will determine the outcome of india’s high risk spending plan.
it’ll decide whether the bond investor turns more sanguine about financing  or the equity market turns more skeptical of v shaped growth.
perhaps the initial reaction of both will be proved a little right  and wrong.

"emi  personal loan  home loan लेने वालों के लिए काम की खबर  ये तरीके अपनाएं  होगा जबरदस्त फायदा  emi  personal loan  home loan   हर इंसान के लिए एक अच्छा करियर और खुद का मकान खरीदना एक सपना होता है। घर बनाने के लिए लोग अपने जीवन भर की पूंजी लगा देता है। हालांकि आज के समय में कई सरकारी व प्राइवेट बैंक और निजी कंपनियां होम लोन  home loan  दे रही हैं। घर खरीदने के लिए लोन तो आसानी से मिल जाता है  लेकिन उसकी भारी भरकम emi सालों का भरनी पड़ती है। जिसका असर सीधे तौर पर जेब पर पड़ता है। होम लोन लेने से पहले इस बात का आकलन करें कि सालाना कमाई कितनी है। उस हिसाब से बैंक से कितना लोन मिलेगा। होम लोन की क्षमता उसे चुकाने की क्षमता पर काफी निर्भर करता है। इसमें मासिक आय  खर्च  परिजनों की कमाई  संपत्ति  देनदारी और आय में स्थिरता जैसे स्थितियों को देखा जाता है। बैंक लोन देने से पहले देखता है कि ग्राहक चुकाने में सक्षम है या नहीं। हर महीने कस्टमर को जितने पैसे मिलते हैं  उस हिसाब से लोन की राशि बढ़ जाती है। बैंक संस्थान यह देखती है मासिक आय का 50 प्रतिशत होम लोन की ईएमआई के रूप में दे सकेंगे या नहीं। इसके साथ बैंक होम लोन के लिए उम्र सीमा भी तय कर चलता है। आज हम आपको कुछ ऐसे तरीके बताने जा रहे हैं  जिसे अपनाकर आप अपने होम लोन के भार को कम कर सकते हैं।    होम लोन भुगतान के लिए लंबी अवधि के बजट छोटी अवधि का चयन करे। इसमें आपको लोन में ईएमआई के साथ कुछ अतिरिक्त पैसा जमा करने होंगे। ऐसे करने से ब्याज लागत में कमी होगी। वहीं लोन का समय से पहले भुगतान करना बेहतर विकल्प है।    दूसरे बैंकों के ब्याज दरों पर नजर बनाए रखें। अगर वहां आपके बैंक से कम ब्याज है तो अपना लोन ट्रांसफर करा सकते हैं। हालांकि पेनाल्टी और प्रोसेसिंग शुल्क का भुगतान करना पड़ता है।    होम लोन लंबे समय का लोन होता है। इस अवधि में लोगों के आय में इजाफा भी होता है। अगर कोई वेतनभोगी सैलरी बढ़ने के साथ अतिरिक्त रकम का भुगतान कर सकता है। यह कर्ज चुकाने का अच्छा तरीका होता है। इससे ईएमआई में बढ़ोतरी बड़ा बदलाव लाती है। इससे लोन की बची अवधि को घटाने में भी सहायता मिलती है।    वहीं एक एसआईपी की सहायता से होम का समय से पहले भुगतान किया जा सकता है। अगर 70 लाख रुपए के 0.
10 फीसद रकम को एसआईपी में लगाएं तो हर माह 7000 रुपए का भुगतान करना होगा। 20 सालों में करीब 16.
80 लाख रुपए निवेश हो जाएगा और कुल पूंजी 1.
04 करोड़ रुपए होगी।    अगर निवेश की राशि हटा दे तो 88 लाख रुपए होंगे  जो होम लोन के ब्याज रकम से ज्यादा होगी। इन पैसों के जल्द डाउन पेमेंट कर मूलधन की रकम को कम कर सकते हैं।  कितना अधिक लोन लिया जा सकता है   किसी मकान या फ्लैट की कीमत का 10 20 फीसद तक डाउन पेमेंट करना होता है। इसके बाद प्रॉपर्टी की वैल्यू का 80 90 फीसद लोन मिल जाता है। अगर बैंक ज्यादा रकम होम लोन में अप्रूव कर दे तब जरूरी नहीं कि सारी रकम लोन के रूप में लिया जाए। प्रॉपर्टी खरीदते समय अधिक से अधिक डाउन पेमेंट करना चाहिए  इससे लोन का बोझ कम रहता है।  जानिए पर्सनल लोन पर कौन सा बैंक दे रहा है कितनी ब्याज दर  नई दिल्ली  बिजनेस डेस्क। पर्सनल लोन कल की आय को आज उपयोग करने का एक रास्ता होता है  लेकिन हमें यह जान लेना चाहिए कि पर्सनल लोन पर ब्याज दरें काफी अधिक होती हैं  इसलिए जब अन्य कोई बेहतर विकल्प नजर नहीं आए  तो ही पर्सनल लोन के लिए जाना चाहिए। अगर आपको कोई छोटा मोटा बिजनेस शुरू करने के लिए पूंजी की आवश्यकता है  तो आपके लिए पर्सनल लोन काफी फायदेमंद होगा। आइए जानते हैं कि एक लाख की लोन राशि व पांच साल की अवधि वाले पर्सनल लोन पर बैंक कितनी ब्याज दर की पेशकश कर रहे हैं।  भारतीय स्टेट बैंक  sbi  एक लाख रुपये की लोन राशि व पांच साल की अवधि वाले पर्सनल लोन पर 9.

80 प्रतिशत के लगभग 15 साल के निचले स्तर पर पहुंच गई हैं। आय निरोधक या कम क्रेडिट स्कोर  उच्च ऋण से आय अनुपात  या ऋण पात्रता मानदंडों को पूरा करने में किसी अन्य विफलता के कारण  यदि किसी को उस राशि से इनकार किया जाता है जिसे उसे उधार लेने की आवश्यकता होती है  तो एक रिश्तेदार के साथ संयुक्त ऋण लेना  उस ऋण को प्राप्त करने की पात्रता बढ़ाता है। इसके अलावा  जैसा कि होम लोन आमतौर पर बड़े टिकट आकार के ऋण होते हैं  बहुत से लोग संयुक्त गृह ऋण लेना पसंद करते हैं। उद्योग के विशेषज्ञों का कहना है कि जीवनसाथी के साथ संयुक्त गृह ऋण  या माता पिता  भाई बहन और बच्चों जैसे अन्य करीबी रिश्तेदारों के साथ संयुक्त ऋण के लिए अनुमोदन प्राप्त करना आसान है। एक सह आवेदक के साथ एक संयुक्त गृह ऋण के लिए जाना  जिसके पास एक बेहतर क्रेडिट प्रोफ़ाइल है  उधारकर्ता के ऋण को अनुमोदित होने की संभावना को बढ़ा सकता है  उसी समय उच्च राशि के लिए योग्य हो सकता है।  कुछ बैंकों के लिए  होम लोन के लिए सह आवेदक होना भी अनिवार्य है  जबकि कुछ ऋणदाता सह स्वामी के सह आवेदक होने पर भी जोर देते हैं। ध्यान दें कि इसका मतलब यह नहीं है कि सह आवेदक को सह मालिक होना चाहिए। एक सह आवेदक ऋण चुकाने के लिए उत्तरदायी है  यदि प्राथमिक आवेदक इसे सेवा देने में असमर्थ है  जबकि संपत्ति का एक सह स्वामी किसी और के साथ संपत्ति साझा करता है। इसलिए  एक पति या पत्नी या रिश्तेदार के साथ एक संयुक्त गृह ऋण लेने पर अपने स्वयं के लाभ और भत्ते के साथ आता है।  एक संयुक्त ऋण की तुलना में  एक व्यक्तिगत ऋण के लिए  उधारकर्ता को एक ऋण सीमा की पेशकश की जाएगी जो बहुत कम होगी। उदाहरण के लिए  एक उधारकर्ता ऋण राशि प्राप्त कर सकता है जो रिश्तेदार / पति / पत्नी की सीमा के साथ संयुक्त होने पर 60 से 70 लाख रुपये तक जा सकती है  जबकि व्यक्तिगत रूप से वह 30 40 लाख रुपये के ऋण के लिए पात्र होगा। इसके साथ ही  उधारकर्ताओं को उनके गृह ऋण पर अतिरिक्त रियायतें भी मिलती हैं। मिसाल के तौर पर  अगर पत्नी होम लोन की प्राथमिक आवेदक है  तो लोन सस्ती दर पर आ सकता है  क्योंकि ज्यादातर बैंक महिला कर्जदारों को कम ब्याज दर देते हैं।  उधारकर्ता भी कर लाभ में वृद्धि का आनंद ले सकते हैं  और अधिकांश व्यक्ति कर लाभ लेने के लिए संयुक्त ऋण का विकल्प चुनते हैं। उदाहरण के लिए  पति या पत्नी दोनों के साथ एक संयुक्त गृह ऋण के मामले में  मूल राशि पर 1.
5 लाख रुपये के धारा 80 सी कर लाभ का अलग अलग आनंद लेते हैं। इसलिए  संयुक्त रूप से धारा 80 सी के तहत कर लाभ सीमा को बढ़ाकर 3 लाख रुपये कर दिया गया है। इसके अतिरिक्त  एक स्व कब्जे वाले घर के लिए भुगतान किए गए ब्याज पर धारा 24 के तहत संयुक्त गृह ऋण के साथ  2 लाख रुपये की कटौती बढ़कर 4 लाख रुपये हो जाती है।  posted by  navodit saktawat  नईदुनिया ई पेपर पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करे  नईदुनिया ई पेपर पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करे  डाउनलोड करें नईदुनिया ऐप   पाएं मध्यप्रदेश  छत्तीसगढ़ और देश दुनिया की सभी खबरों के साथ नईदुनिया ई पेपर राशिफल और कई फायदेमंद सर्विसेस  डाउनलोड करें नईदुनिया ऐप   पाएं मध्यप्रदेश  छत्तीसगढ़ और देश दुनिया की सभी खबरों के साथ नईदुनिया ई पेपर राशिफल और कई फायदेमंद सर्विसेस",emi  personal loan  home loan to work for those who take these ways  will be tremendous advantage

5 lakh crore  and introduced an agri infra and development cess of up to 100 per cent to create post harvest infrastructure for improving farmers  income.
the minister also proposed higher allocation for rural infrastructure development fund and micro irrigation fund  and extended agriculture infrastructure fund to apmcs for augmenting infrastructure facilities.
2020 has been a year of exceptional and unprecedented challenges and has highlighted the critical importance of two core sectors  agriculture and healthcare.
the union budget 2021 has correctly called out the role of these two sectors in leading the nation s recovery and being catalysts to sustainable growth   said d narain  senior bayer representative  south asia and ceo   md  bayer cropscience.
higher allocations for both healthcare and agriculture with specific focus on building public health infrastructure  expansion of credit to farmers  additional allocation for rural infrastructure and micro irrigation are welcome moves  he said.
ram kaundinya  director general  federation of seed industry of india said it is a status quo budget for agriculture and seed industry.
agriculture contributed significantly to our successful fight against covid.
but the sector did not get the needed attention in the budget.
no transformative measures have been proposed.
kaundinya also pointed out that investments in research in agriculture are not addressed  especially since research and innovation are one of the six pillars of aatmanirbhar bharat and there is a need to scale up private sector investment in agricultural research.
seed industry was expecting restoration of 200 per cent tax deduction of research expenses but it has not been met  he added.
maithili appalwar  ceo  avana  said   the proposed outlay of rs 2.
87 lakh crore under the jal jeevan mission supports our vision of water conservation and sanitation.
with agriculture taking a centre stage in this year s budget  we appreciate the government s pragmatic measures of an influx of rs 10 000 crore as part of the micro irrigation corpus fund  a double since last fiscal.
asitava sen  the ceo of agrochemical industries  body croplife india  said that with a view to reducing overall cost of production for farmers  the gst on agrochemicals could have been reduced from the current 18  to 12.
further  the government should provide 200  weighted deduction on r d expenses by agrochemical companies to encourage innovation and introduction of new technologies   sen said.
dcm shriram chairman and sr managing director ajay shriram said the budget 2021 is a growth oriented budget.
focus on capital expenditure across the board is a positive sign which will stimulate growth by creating demand  jobs and incomes.
we need more focus on ease of doing business going forward also.
hailing the budget  ncdex md and ceo vijay kumar said the government s proposals will take development of the agricultural eco system to the next level.
the decision to allow use of the agriculture infra fund corpus for the upliftment of apmc market yards will aid establishment of a vibrant agriculture market and improved price discovery in the farm sector.
indian chamber of food and agriculture  icfa  said the budget contains many positive steps for agriculture and if the provisions are well implemented  it would further improve the prosperity in the sector.
the budget has unravelled a slew of measures which would address some of the key concerns of the farmers.
the objective is to improve the purchasing power of the rural populace  augment rural prosperity and promote inclusive growth  it said.
pesticides manufacturers and formulators association president pradip dave said   largely  this budget does not have much for us.
.
.
.
the only upside is that the proposed increase of agriculture credit is likely to increase the purchasing power of the farmers  which will  in turn  become a factor of growth for the agrochemical sector.
according to national cooperative union of india  ncui  chief executive satya narayana   the proposal to set up a separate administrative structure for multi state cooperative societies will definitely strengthen these cooperatives to compete in the market economy.
such structural reforms are necessary so that these cooperatives become success stories.
national collateral management services ltd  ncml  president unupom kausik said  it is aspirational  honest and transparent  trust based and forward looking  budget.
first time in a long history  we are seeing no accounting gimmicks on deficit.
the agriculture infrastructure and development cess will certainly support for meeting the short term resource requirements for government s multiple programmes working towards doubling farmer s income  he added.
lawrencedale agro processing india  leaf  founder and ceo palat vijayaraghavan said the core focus on post harvest management is an extremely important one for the indian agriculture sector to flourish and grow.
netafim india md randhir chauhan welcomed the government s decision to double the allocation to the micro irrigation fund  mif  under nabard to rs 10 000 cr.
in order to improve the fund utilization  we request policy makers to remove the condition of disbursement  which is only against additional subsidy  and consider to make it available for the mandatory state share as well   he said.

"oppo is reportedly gearing up to launch two new devices in its find x series  the oppo find x3  and the oppo find x3 pro.
both these smartphones have been in the news lately  considering the teasers from the company  and few benchmark leaks.
now  the latest news is regarding the oppo find x3 pro  which had made its stop by cloud testing platform.
this testing platform reveals few key specs of the device  including display resolution  and camera details.
oppo find x3 pro spotted on cloud testing platform  the details of the upcoming oppo find x3 pro has been spotted on the cloud testing platform.
the listing reveals that the find x3 pro might feature a display resolution of 1440 x 3216 pixels with an adaptive refresh rate ranging from 10hz to 120hz.
the display size is supposed to be of 6.
67 inch with an oled panel.
moving to the hardware of the device  it is the handset might feature 12gb of ram and 256gb storage.
it may pack the qualcomm’s latest snapdragon 888 chipset with adreno 660 gpu.
if we go by the use of three cpu clusters  one of them is of 2.

the find x3 pro has scored 4 236 and 13 323 points in single and multi core test respectively.
the geekbench listing  as usual  can be manipulated  and we can’t assure that this a genuine one.
considering the earlier leaked specs  the find x3 pro is said to feature a triple rear camera setup  which might consist of the primary 50 megapixel imx766 image sensor from sony.
the secondary camera is supposed to be a 13mp telephoto lens with a 2x optical zoom  and the third sensor could be of 3mp.

rumours suggest us that oppo might launch both the oppo find x3 and the find x3 pro sometime in march or april.
now  that the chinese smartphone maker has started sharing a few teasers lately  we possibly even could see these devices launching sooner than the rumoured timeframe.

"different stories  the same ideology  undeniably  there are similarities  but if the parallel is attractive  we must beware of hasty identifications.
we must never forget that in france  the national front  fn  was founded by former collaborationists and other ss  neofascist militants of the new order and the statutes were deposited by pierre bousquet.
from its birth  this political movement  led by jean marie le pen  an extreme poujadist  was based on a deep racism  a visceral hatred of the left and of the workers’ movement  and the call for an authoritarian state.
.
all its ideological construction reflects obvious links with fascism.
to take just one example  it should be noted that the historic logo of the fn  the flame  is directly inspired by the italian movement msi  an italian neofascist party  founded in 1946 by people close to mussolini.
in the case of donald trump  he came to politics late  being first a more or less crooked businessman  member of the democratic party  before running for the republican primaries in 2015.
from the start  he multiplied the attacks against minorities  not hesitating to use excess to radicalize his electoral base against a background of racism  xenophobia  misogyny  where the former american president  initially advised by steve bannon  an ideologue claiming the heritage of the nazi thinker julius evola   has shown a closeness to violent and racist extreme right wing groups  proud boys  etc.
marine le pen claims to have been working for years towards  demonization   attempting to conceal its proximity to small groups like génération identitaire or the gud  even though the links are obvious  and not only in terms of ideology.
the objective of  lepenism  is obvious  to present a respectable face to popularize the ultra reactionary ideas of the french far right and thus to conquer political power.
while fundamental differences exist  some similarities can be noted.
in addition to xenophobic and racist speeches  as well as a call to restore order and security in defiance of public freedoms  these currents have a recurring practice of lying.
according to a statement made by the washington post as of july 9  2020  trump had uttered 20 055 false information.
in france  jean marie le pen  and today marine le pen  have implemented the same strategy to saturate the media space.
for years  the president of the rn has  for example  repeated that a credit card is distributed to all migrants upon their arrival in europe.
we know this is wrong.
as recently as last week  a member of the european parliament  jean lin lacapelle  claimed  that no one under the age of 44 had died from the new coronavirus.
again  this is a huge lie.
thanks to the significant presence of the far right in the  big  media and on social networks  it has achieved the feat of convincing part of the population  by relying on a very understandable mistrust.
‘regard to media subservient to large capitalist groups.
trumpism and lepenism do not have the same history and operate in different contexts  but they are both extremely dangerous in that they play hard on the map of the  racialization  of social problems  pointing to the stranger as the cause of all the evils of society.
two movements to fight therefore  in the heads  in the street as in the ballot box.
postfascism and confusionism  extreme right  trumpism  and extreme right  marine lepenism   in their intersections and their crossroads  draw the new faces of an ultraconservatism that has enjoyed a certain attractiveness on an international scale since the mid 2000s  by benefiting the blurring of previously stabilized political benchmarks and increasing the fog a little more.
intersections  xenophobia and hostility to the pluricultural and mixed tendencies of modern societies on a nationalist background  the fetishization of a compact people nation and largely closed in on itself largely fantasized  abuse of the superficial provocations of the  politically incorrect  and of the false conspiracy lucidity instead of radical social criticism.
cross over  the american extreme right is slipping on the slopes of sexism and homophobia the most uninhibited  even anti semitism  while in search of respectability the french extreme right is police on these lands yet traditional for it.
fascism or populism then  staying hooked on the first term would make us risk the folklorization of an evil that would repeat itself over and over again in the same forms  without regard for the work of history.
the second  with multiple and vague uses  between an automatic mode of stigmatization of the popular for some and demand for a positive incarnation of the people by elites who do not recognize themselves as such for others  does not allow us to understand the continuities with fascism.
historical  thus relativizing the danger.
the notion of  postfascism  would make it easier to grasp both continuities  in  postfascism   there is  fascism   and discontinuities  the  post    and in particular the reappropriation of the republican and democratic lexicon   république     popular sovereignty  merged with  national sovereignty     freedom  and  equality     secularism    etc.
out of step with the anti republican and anti democratic discourse in progress in the 1930s.
however  the extreme right wing brought about by both trumpism and lepenism does not work by their own strength  but also thanks to the paralysis  ambiguities and confusions on the left.
the extension of the fields of confusionism  that is to say the development of lexical and ideological interferences between extreme right  right  moderate left and radical left  especially benefits ultra conservatism.
when we put forward the nation and the borders  while denigrating the world and suspecting migrants  when some legitimize forms of stigmatization of islam and others underestimate anti semitism  when we are tempted by   bonnet blanc et blanc bonnet  between penism and macronism  when we use the strings of conspiracy to bounce back on the political scene  when the demonization of the media replaces the deployment of the emancipatory imagination  etc.
we unconsciously participate in weave the web of rhetoric likely to suffocate us.
and let’s not forget that figures from the left publicly expressed a certain fascination with trump at the time of his election in 2016… what if we instead reinvented an emancipation left",lepenism  a french style trumpism

last year  the hole was played 397 times during the tournament  and 349 players opted for the green  a clip of almost 88.
now  finding the green was another story  only 69 players hit the green with their tee shot  meaning that just 19.
8 percent players who tried to drive the green ended up with an eagle putt.
this rate was in fact an increase over the previous year  because quite simply 18 percent of players who tried to drive the green found the putting surface in 2019.
the story continues  a big reason for the aggressive approach  besides the prospect of an easy birdie  is the fact that the pose is not really easy.
with cross bunkers guarding the center of the fairway  players can still face an uphill battle if an iron layup turns even slightly askew.
last year  48 players were off the tee  but only 29 subsequently reached the green in settlement.
for those who stopped  the hole played on par  average of 4.
17.
the longer  the better  it’s hardly a shock in today’s game  but the players who hit him longer off the tee last year were way ahead of the competition on the 17th hole.
now  that’s partly because the penalty area guarding the left side of the green dropped a few shots  and interrupted their teeing distance in the process.
but those who were able to navigate between the various obstacles to the narrowing green had increasing success depending on the distance traveled by the tee shot   global conversion rate for 2020  to green   69 out of 349 shots  19.
77 percent   conversion rate for over 300 tee shots  69 out of 288  23.
96 percent   conversion rate for tee shots over 330 yards  5 out of 19  26.
32 percent   last year the average tee shot was 305 yards  while the five year average on that hole is 302.
5 yards.
the longest tee shot a year ago went too far  it traveled 351 yards and rolled to the back of the green  narrowly missing the water at the back edge.
beware of the water  speaking of wet things  a tee shot in the water is a guarantee that a potential birdie opportunity will immediately turn into an uphill battle to save par.
the relatively low 17 scoring average last year was largely due to those who found the green off the tee  an accurate shot that made the birdie a likely outcome.
the hole played much closer to par for players who took the green and missed   2020 score for those who drove the green  3.
16  4 eagles  50 birdies  15 pars   2020 score for those who went green and missed  3.
81  2 eagles  95 birdies  142 pars  38 bogeys  1 double bogey  2 triple bogeys   but the trend in scores increased significantly when looking only at the 51 players who found water off the tee  even though one player may have made a hole after taking a drop for an unlikely birdie   2020 score for water tee shots  4.
65  1 birdie  19 pars  29 bogeys  1 double bogey  1 triple bogey   the previous year was marked by a tied division  in 2019  there were 32 waterballs on this hole.
sixteen players managed to save par  while 16 left with a bogey.

वास्तव में  सोने को करीब 3 हजार साल से भी ज्यादा वक्त से लोग स्टोरेज करते आ रहे हैं.
भारत मे सोने का  भगवान का धन  माना जाता है और इसे खास मौके पर मंदिरों में चढ़ाया जाता है.

the decision to open up the insurance sector  setting up a dfi and an arc  privatizing a couple of public sector banks are all positive steps for the financial sector.
social sectors have received large attention in the budget with a thrust on developing a health and education infrastructure on a mission mode.
this will augment human capital  an essential prerequisite for inclusive growth   sbi chairman dinesh kumar khara said.
the budget rightly strikes a reasonable balance between addressing the key pillars of health and well being  inclusive development  human capital  apart from laying the path for a robust economy by providing a major infrastructure boost  s s mallikarjuna rao  md   ceo  punjab national bank said.
the array of measures announced are in line with people as well as market expectations and will go a long way to bring the nation back on track by boosting spending on infrastructure and rural development while fighting the pandemic through health focused measures.
as far as the financial sector is concerned  further recapitalization of rs 20 000 crore for psbs in the fy 2021 22 is a welcome step   rao said.
also  the creation of an arc and asset management company that will take over the stressed assets and sell to alternative investment funds  aifs   is also welcome as it will help improve the health of the banking sector through impact on price discovery and improving competition in the market  said the head of the delhi headquartered lender.

8 per cent of gdp in fy22 compared to a revised estimate of 9.
5 per cent for fy21.
the focus has been on increasing capital expenditure.

in light of the covid 19 health crisis  the budget’s focus on health and sanitisation with increased allocations and introduction of a new health scheme are also welcome steps.
that said  the budget does not adequately address concerns over inequitable growth which has been a worry across the globe due to the pandemic.
there has been no specific support for sectors stressed due to the pandemic like the hospitality sector   barua said.
while the government did not increase any direct taxes  as some sections of the market feared  there has also not been any cushion provided for households – especially in the informal sector that has been hit the most by the pandemic  he said further.

46 billion at september 30  2020  as paydown and payoff activity remains robust.
excluding ppp loan originations of  596 million  2020 origination levels of approximately  885 million were less than 2019’s level of  1.
3 billion  due to the impact of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020.

our corporate advisory pipelines are also strong.
funding / liquidity / interest rate risk management the company actively manages its deposit base to reduce reliance on wholesale sourced deposits  volatility  and/or operational risk.
total deposits at december 31  2020 were  4.
82 billion reflecting an increase of  575 million when compared to  4.
24 billion at december 31  2019.
noninterest bearing demand deposits increased  304 million  interest bearing demand increased  339 million  brokered deposits declined  70 million  and higher costing cds declined  119 million.
mr.
kennedy noted   of our total deposits  only 17  are not covered by fdic insurance  reinforcing the  core  nature of our deposit base.
for the quarter ended december 31  2020  the company’s balance sheet liquidity  investments  interest earning deposits and cash  totaled  1.
3 billion  or 22  of assets.
in addition to the  1.
3 billion of balance sheet liquidity  the company also had approximately  1.
8 billion of secured funding available from the federal home loan bank.
additionally  the company also had  988 million of secured funding available from the federal reserve discount window.
as noted previously  during the fourth quarter of 2020  the bank prepaid  105 million of fhlb advances with an average rate in excess of 3.
mr.
kennedy noted   as a commercial bank  a large portion of our loans reprice when the fed changes rates.
the 150 basis point reduction in target fed funds near the end of the first quarter of 2020 reduced the company’s yield earned on assets.
however  we were able and continue to strategically reprice our deposits over time to offset much of that decline.
further  when interest rate rise  our net interest income will improve.
our current modeling indicates that net interest income would improve 8.
5  with an immediate 100 basis points rise in rates.

"new delhi  feb 1  pti  the delhi high court monday sought to know whether us based e commerce giant amazon and kishore biyani led future retail ltd  frl  were open to resolving the issue arising out of rs 24 713 crore deal between frl and reliance retail.
the counsel for both  amazon and future group  submitted that they would seek instructions and inform the court on tuesday.
the court was hearing a plea by amazon seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by singapore s emergency arbitrator  ea  restraining frl from going ahead with its rs 24 713 crore deal with reliance retail.
amazon.
com nv investment holdings llc  in its plea  also sought detention of the biyanis  directors of future coupons pvt ltd  fcpl  and frl and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged  wilful disobedience  of the emergency arbitrator s order.
justice j r midha asked the parties to inform it on tuesday if any such endeavour could be made and clarified that this should not be taken as deferring the proceedings and it would continue as scheduled.
the court  which asked if any attempt has been made to resolve the issue  suggested that if parties would be willing  it can refer the matter to two retired judges of the supreme court.
the court also said it will consider whatever protective order can be passed.
in commercial matters  it is always helpful to find a solution   it said.
to this  senior advocate gopal subramanium  representing amazon  said he will take instructions on it as nothing tangible has happened.
senior advocate darius khambata  representing frl  also said he will take instructions and inform the court.
amazon has approached the high court seeking to restrain kishore biyani led future group from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the mukesh dhirubhai ambani  mda  group.
it also sought to restrain future group from taking any steps to transfer or dispose of frl s retail assets or the shares held in frl by the biyanis in any manner without prior written consent of amazon.
the future group and amazon have been locked in a battle after the us based company took frl into the emergency arbitration over alleged breach of a contract between them.
the three domestic firms    frl  fcpl and reliance    have however contended before the high court that if amazon s claim    that it indirectly invested in frl by investing in fcl    was accepted then it would amount to a violation of indian foreign direct investment laws which permit only 10 per cent investment by a foreign entity in the multi brand retail sector.
according to amazon  the ea award passed under the singapore international arbitration centre  siac  rules is enforceable under section 17 2  of the arbitration and conciliation act.
it referred to an order passed by the high court on december 21  2020  prima facie holding that the ea s award was valid under the indian law.
senior advocate harish salve  also representing frl  had earlier submitted that amazon had a deal with fcpl and signed an agreement with biyani.
fcpl has a shareholding agreement with frl which has no agreement with amazon.
subramanium had urged that frl shall not further precipitate the situation as the matter is being heard by the court.
in the petition  amazon has alleged that future group  kishore biyani and other promoters and directors have  deliberately and maliciously disobeyed  the ea award despite it being binding on them and not having challenged it in accordance with the law.
the majority respondents  action of simply ignoring the order  of ea  and continuing with the impugned transaction  deal  is not only contumacious but calls into serious question their respect for enforceability of contracts  the rule of law and the administration of justice.
.
it said.
it sought to injunct future group and its officials from taking any steps in furtherance of the deal with reliance.
in august last year  future had reached an agreement to sell its retail  wholesale  logistics and warehousing units to reliance.
the siac on october 25 last year  had passed an interim order in favour of amazon barring frl from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.
subsequently  amazon wrote to market regulator sebi  stock exchanges and competition commission of india  cci   urging them to take into consideration the singapore arbitrator s interim decision as it is a binding order  frl had earlier told the high court.
as per the siac interim order  a three member arbitration panel needs to be set up within 90 days  from the date of the judgement  with one judge each being appointed by future and amazon  along with a third neutral judge.
on november 10  2020  amazon had told the court that it and fcl have appointed their respective arbitrators.

as a researcher who studies social media  people and society  i am concerned about the effects of surveillance capitalism.
this includes social media companies profiting from collecting user data  making algorithmic inferences about people’s preferences and using this information to target people with advertising.
features like instagram’s shop tab facilitate surveillance capitalism  so it is important to look at their consequences.
many people use instagram to share their lives with other people  but the redesign is shifting the nature of the social media platform toward online commerce.
this shift opens people to highly targeted advertising and makes them vulnerable to advertising that exploits their emotional experiences.
shift to shopping  research  including my own  shows that people use instagram to record their big and mundane moments  find community  exchange social support  express identities and keep in touch with friends.
in 2017  colleagues and i showed how ad hoc communities form around the tag  depression on the platform  and how much of the discourse is to make sense of the experience of depression  record it  share it with others and exchange support with other people dealing with depression.
i argued that it is important for the platform to recognise the value users find in these communities and support them  rather than ban or nudge them to go elsewhere when they come to the platform to express themselves and build solidarity.
the notification button  represented as a heart icon  brings up a screen that indicates the interactions people have had with your instagram presence – for example  who has liked your posts and comments.
it is likely that the notification button was the most frequently clicked tab.
when people interact with technology  they form habits.
i am probably not the only one clicking the new shop tab when i mean to click the notification button.
it is possible that the company did this simply to ensure that instagram users encounter the new feature  but there are other ways to accomplish that.
by choosing to make the shop tab central to its platform  instagram is sending its users a message  this platform is a business  and interactions on this platform are going to be commodified.
though some people may come to instagram to find things to buy  many do not.
app designers can provide an unneeded feature and create a need for it over time.
this is not without precedence in the context of social media and shopping.
for example  when facebook  which owns instagram  relaunched facebook marketplace in 2016  the marketplace product manager  bowen pan  said   we show you the most relevant items for you  even if you do not know what you want.
potential harms  people share all kinds of personal information on instagram  such as mental health  physical health  traumatic events  pregnancy  loss  infertility  becoming new parents and getting married.
social media companies’ access to such sensitive information is a concern  for how the companies could exploit the information and the risk of third party access to the data.
instagram can use computational techniques to infer people’s affective states – their emotions and moods – based on many signals available to the platform.
these include what content users view and post.
there is substantial evidence that emotions and affective states play a key role in advertising.
while capitalising on emotions and emotional personal experiences for profit is not unique to social media or algorithms  the data driven  opaque and hyperpersonalised approaches boost the scale of potential harm.
presumably  what people see in instagram’s shop is personalised based on what the platform’s recommendation algorithm determines they would like and be inclined to purchase.
how does the inferred socioeconomic  gender  age  race and other attributes shape what the platform recommends to users in the shop tab  what shops get to be recommended and visible  instagram users can be as young as 13  the age required to open an account.
how does personalisation work for children  how does this feature affect the experience of individuals with low socioeconomic status  what principles and values is the platform adhering to in designing these recommendation algorithms  staff picks and other means of presenting products   a major consideration is when people get recommendations to purchase items during vulnerable moments.
sharing or seeking information about a difficult  personal experience on a social media platform and then having the platform capitalise on an algorithmic understanding of the experience – which might or might not be accurate – is problematic.
what are the implications for impulsive buyers who may turn to instagram as a space for community and peer support to resist impulsive purchasing  but who are instead confronted with things to purchase and have no way of opting out  how about for someone who is on the platform to find support while coping with a substance use disorder  but instead encounters recommendations to purchase items related to drinking  what happens if a person posting about experiences with pregnancy loss begins seeing ads for baby clothes  this last scenario has happened.
in recent and upcoming studies  i observed that  to varying degrees  people find social media platforms capitalising on their personal  intimate experiences – especially those associated with negative emotions – manipulative and harmful.
social media platform designers and decision makers should consider ways to address potential harms preemptively rather than retroactively.
the instagram blog post announcing the shop feature states that there are marketers and influencers on the platform and young people who want to purchase the same products their favourite creators use.
this might be a need for some instagram users  but not all.
if instagram is determined to emphasise shopping  and if opting in is not possible  i believe the company should allow users to opt out of the shop feature.
losing personal connections  recent research has shown that people share less and less personal information on facebook  which has had its marketplace feature since 2016  and use platforms like instagram to engage in more personal  intimate discourse.
this is due in part to site features and whom people are connected to on each platform.
by moving away from a focus on people and their connections  and by commodifying and potentially manipulating users to purchase items on the platform  instagram could go down the road that facebook did – fewer personal connections and less personal  meaningful content.
instagram’s website states that it is  bringing you closer to the people and things you love.
but people and things are different phenomena  and the ways people feel closer to each other are different from the ways they are drawn to things  businesses and brands.
by wanting to do both  or perhaps by using the former to benefit the latter  the company may be missing the mark on how to bring people closer together.

"adtance smart services platform delivers first multi camera fieldstreaming video support from all camera types  globenewswire2021 02 02  live multi angle video customer support accelerates machine repairs  reduces downtime  improves remote training and facilitates long distance collaboration    adtance   a leading international after sales service technology platform provider for manufactures  industrial companies and mechanical engineering organizations  today announced a new adtance support module and fieldstreaming solution that is fully integrated into the adtance smart services platform 4.
0.
the adtance fieldstreaming solution is the first live remote support software capable of connecting every type of camera to the system  including cameras within smartphones  tablets  computers  security cameras  drones and underwater remote operated vehicles  rovs.
adtance support users can live stream views of machines from various angles simultaneously– significantly improving live support  remote training and long distance collaboration in the field.
the solution can be implemented by using mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets or by wearing smartglasses.
we’ve seen customer demand for live remote support  training and collaboration skyrocket – in part because of the current covid 19 challenges  but also due to increasingly complex machines and a shortage of highly skilled technicians   said nils arnold  co founder and ceo of adtance.
our new adtance support and fieldstreaming solution is uniquely suited to address the growing set of remote service use cases.
companies want service technicians to be able to view machines from a variety of angles in real time  conduct live remote user training from multiple perspectives  and collaborate remotely using multiple cameras.
our new support module and fieldstreaming solution makes all these use cases possible and simple.
adtance’s fieldstreaming solution is a game changer for us   said michael ntagas  director of after sales service at reifenhäuser group.
now we are able to build an entire machine – sixteen meters high – and get the technical assistance we need 100  remotely.
after the machine is built  we can remotely educate and train machine operators  effectively collaborate long distance with our customers to test new mixtures of raw materials running in the machine  and upgrade machines without traveling to the customer site.
adtance support and fieldstreaming solution reduces the significant costs and current risks of traveling to customer sites  while increasing the number of customers our highly technical experts can service.
the adtance support module also includes the following new capabilities that improve communication and collaboration between service technicians and customers.
expanded support session communications  users can now start an adtance support session by sending a message  document  or video recording in addition to initiating a session through a video call.
users do not need to download an app  as adtance support now runs on all browsers and mobile devices.
invitations to sessions can be shared by simply sending a link without the need to set up a user account.
at any time during a session  users can send messages  documents  recordings  open a live video chat or collaborate using a digital whiteboard.
snapshots during live video stream  snapshots can be taken at any time during the adtance support live video stream and users can mark up the video with circles  arrows or pertinent notes.
several people can work on a snapshot within the support session at the same time.
a service technician simply sends a request to the field worker and once it is accepted  the system automatically executes a snapshot.
alternatively  users have the option to immediately accept all snapshots for a session prior to starting the video call.
this allows the service expert to take snapshots at any time during the live video stream.
reactivate closed sessions anytime  adtance support now allows closed sessions to be reactivated and viewed again at any time.
the documentation remains in place and participants can be invited back into the session.
this saves time and significantly improves customer service  especially when there is a complex or recurring problem with the same customer.
the new capabilities in adtance support are very impressive   said stephan czwick  product manager at schuler group.
the ability to rejoin closed sessions is particularly valuable.
a technician can view or restart a session days later and still have all the important information of the case intact  which allows the service expert to immediately pick up where they left off with the customer.
this can save our technicians a tremendous amount of time and improve customer satisfaction.
broad language translation  adtance support now includes translation for 147 different languages.
users simply select a language  speak  then click a button and the system translates their speech into the selected language.
this unparalleled language support enables companies to leverage their highly technical experts on a global basis.

"new delhi  feb 1  pti  the proposal to increase customs duty on certain imported automotive parts in the union budget 2020 21 will lead to increase in car prices  according to merecedes benz india and skoda auto volkswagen  even as component makers said the step will encourage local manufacturing of such items.
the government on monday proposed an increase in customs duty on certain imported components used in automobiles.
in the budget 2021 22  finance minister nirmala sitharaman proposed increase in customs duty of various parts  including ignition wiring sets  safety glass and parts of signalling equipment to 15 per cent with effect from february 2.
the parts would also attract agriculture infrastructure and development cess at the rate of 5 per cent.
currently  the parts attract customs duty in the range of 7.
5 10 per cent.
the increase in the rise in auto component duties is unexpected in such a revival period  and it will increase the production cost  leading to higher cost for consumers   mercedes benz india managing director and ceo martin schwenk said in a statement.
besides  there could have been further push towards e mobility by lowering import duties on electric vehicles  he added.
similarly  skoda auto volkswagen india managing director gurpratap boparai said the increase in customs duty on certain auto parts to 15 per cent will further increase input costs and prices for cars which depend on specialised components which cannot be manufactured locally due to unviable volumes.
it is important to keep in mind that even in the coming financial year  the passenger vehicle market is unlikely to reach the level of 2018 and the much required rationalisation of gst and cess to aid the auto industry was missing  he added.
both schwenk and boparai however welcomed the announcement of scrappage policy.
the government said the changes in basic customs duty is for creating level playing fields for the benefit of micro  small and medium enterprises  msmes  and other domestic manufacturers.
we are raising custom duty on certain auto parts to 15 per cent to bring them on par with the general rate of auto parts   sitharaman said in her budget speech.
automotive component manufacturers association president deepak jain said the increase in basic customs duty on select auto components will encourage local manufacturing of such items.
hailing the announcement of the scrappage policy  he noted that the announcements with regards increased spend on road infrastructure  voluntary scrappage policy  research and development and pli among others  augur well for the automotive sector.
similarly  federation of automobile dealers associations  fada  president vinkesh gulati said if 1990 is taken as a base year  there were around 37 lakh commercial vehicles and 52 lakh passenger vehicles eligible for voluntary scrapping.
we still need to see the fine prints to access the kind of incentives which will be on offer and thus have a positive effect on retail   he added.
hyundai motor india managing director  md  and chief executive officer  ceo  ss kim said the proposed vehicle scrappage policy will provide thrust towards procurement of new automobiles and have a strong positive effect giving a boost to atmanirbhar bharat.
tata motors ceo and md guenter butschek said voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and unfit vehicles  augmenting public transport system in urban areas  continuing focus on adoption of cleaner fuels  and enhancing outlays for developing road infrastructure are positive steps for the auto industry.
toyota kirloskar motor  tkm  vice chairman vikram kirloskar said the long awaited scrapping policy could contribute to lower fuel consumption  lessen pollution while also generating additional demand for cleaner new vehicles.
the auto sector welcomes this announcement and is hopeful that for realising full benefits there will be an early and full implementation of this policy   he added.
similarly  honda cars india senior vice president   director  marketing and sales  rajesh goel said the scrappage policy was one of the long awaited announcements for the auto sector.
expressing similar views  renault india operations country ceo and managing director venkatram mamillapalle said the policy will significantly reduce pollution and should help bolster demand for new vehicles in the commercial and passenger vehicle sectors.
mahindra   mahindra md and ceo pawan goenka said   though details are not yet out  when the policy comes out  it should have full incentive for scrapping and not just disincentive for not scrapping.
the union budget 2021 has several positive signals for the manufacturing sector and the commercial vehicles  cv  sector  which are core to the economy  ashok leyland md and ceo vipin sondhi said.
the rs 18 000 crore scheme to augment public transport in urban areas with the addition of 20 000 new buses in a ppp model would ensure cleaner and efficient public transportation and ease congestion  he added.
apollo tyres chairman onkar s kanwar also said the voluntary vehicle scrappage policy will provide the much needed fillip to the auto and tyre industry.
sitharaman on monday announced the much awaited voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and polluting vehicles.
presenting the budget for 2021 22 in parliament  sitharaman said that under voluntary vehicle scrapping policy  personal vehicles would undergo fitness tests after 20 years while commercial vehicles would require it after completion of 15 years.
road transport  highways and msmes minister nitin gadkari said the policy will lead to new investment of around rs 10 000 crore and create as many as 50 000 jobs.
he further said the policy would cover over 1 crore light  medium and heavy motor vehicles.

"silver rallied on monday  touching levels last seen in 2013  as an army of retail traders stormed into the metal  switching their focus from gamestop corp   blackberry ltd and other stocks  while short sellers licked their wounds after a brutal start to 2021.
as traders turned their attention to silver   a bigger and more liquid market than the individual stocks targeted until last week   shares of gamestop fell by a third in morning trade and were down 22  at  253 in early afternoon.
its shares have soared 1 600  this year as small time investors scooped up assets big fund managers had bet against  or  shorted.
another retail darling  amc entertainment holdings inc   was up 8  on monday  having risen more than 500  this year.
blackberry shares were higher in both new york and toronto trading.
advertisement  shorting shares of gamestop cost hedge funds a total  12.
5 billion over january  data from financial analytics firm ortex showed on monday.
the number of gamestop shares shorted fell by over half in a week as these short sellers covered their bets  s3 partners said  although the retailer remained a highly shorted stock.
melvin capital  which bet against gamestop  lost 53  in january.
as a new week of trading begins  it remains to be seen how long the reddit fueled rally in traditionally unloved stocks will last.
more immediately  it could mean more market losses if hedge funds have to keep selling to meet redemptions or right their portfolios.
longer term  they may have to shift strategies.
monday s moves were relatively small compared with swings last week when small time traders  who organised in online forums and traded with fee free brokers such as robinhood  saddled several powerful hedge funds with losses on their short positions.
mining stocks rally  instead  the frenzy was more apparent in spot silver  which headed for its biggest one day rise since 2008.
the ishares silver trust etf  the largest silver backed etf  was up 9  in u.
s.
trading.
friday s retail inflows into the etf totalled around  950 million  equivalent to two weeks of demand  in a total annual silver market of  25 billion  according to bmo capital markets.
the silver market is not large   about 1 billion ounces annually  or  28 billion at spot   so it is relatively easy to move the price  said portfolio manager maria smirnova at precious metals focused fund manager sprott inc  a long term silver investor.
gold and silver are direct beneficiaries of low to negative real interest rates and fiat currency debasement   she said.
a general economic post covid recovery is also helping the silver price.
silver is also benefiting from being  green   used in solar panels  electric vehicles and 5g networks  but it remains far off a 2011 high of almost  50 per ounce  she said.
silver s increase of almost 20  since wednesday ignited a rally in silver mining stocks globally  with fresnillo plc shares soaring 14  in london trading.
toronto listed silver miners rose sharply.
big gainers were first majestic silver   fortuna silver mines   silvercorp metals inc and pan american silver.
goldman sachs said the amount of position covering last week by u.
s.
hedge funds  buying and selling  was the highest since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
wall street s retail trading frenzy has distorted markets  global hedge funds industry body aima said on monday.
some on the online reddit wallstreetbets group  or wsb  urged followers to keep their focus on gamestop.
we just have to stick to the same plan we’ve had all along  hold   we didn’t go through the blood bath last week for nothing  keep it up boys    a user posted  referring to gamestop s decline from nearly  500.
wall street s main indexes climbed on monday following a steep sell off last week  as the shift in the retail trading frenzy to silver drove up mining stocks.
miners also lifted european shares.
hurting short sellers  the furore began on thursday after posts on the r/wallstreetbets reddit message board   the same one used to spark frenzied buying of gamestop shares   urged investors to buy physical silver.
get out there and buy at least 4 ounces of silver as soon as you can   one forum participant posted.
retail traders poured a record a 40 million   30.
6 million  into australian etf securities  physical silver fund by the afternoon.
a silver etf in japan surged 11.
global short interest in silver  or the cumulative value of bets it falls in price  is equivalent to about 900 million ounces  just short of annual global production.
banks and brokers hold most of that but it is not clear whether they are net short on the metal or whether their bets offset very big physical holdings.
analysts say a silver short squeeze is unlikely.
unlike in gamestop  there are no holders of massive silver short positions who can be forced to abandon them in big enough numbers to send prices through the roof.
unlike single stocks  the market for silver is much larger and more complex and therefore more difficult to manipulate   said raffi boyadjian  senior investment analyst at xm  in a note.
jpmorgan analysts said fundamentals did not justify a sustained decoupling of silver prices from gold.
gold prices rose less than 1  on monday.
but they warned  the frenzy of retail buying has rebased silver prices higher for the time being.

"diabetes during pregnancy can cause problems for both baby and mother.
some women may develop high blood sugar levels during pregnancy  a condition that is known as gestational diabetes mellitus  gdm.
this can increase the odds of pregnancy complications like c section  preterm birth and even stillbirth.
diabetes during pregnancy can also cause the babies to grow too large and lead to excessive birth weight.
babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes are may be at increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome  low blood sugar  hypoglycemia   obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.
also read   doctors successfully deliver 649 grams premature baby  know all about this rare case  studies have also shown that women with gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing high blood pressure and preeclampsia during pregnancy and type 2 diabetes later in life.
also read   coronary heart disease  reasons why women experience worse outcomes after bypass surgery  if you have or had diabetes during pregnancy  you’re more likely to develop heart disease later in life  according to a new study.
also read   egg freezing on rise in india  is it the best choice to make  know the pros and cons  gestational diabetes linked to heart artery calcification  in the new study  researchers from kaiser permanente in california  us found that women with a history of gestational diabetes were twice as likely to develop calcium in heart arteries – which is a strong predictor of heart disease – by mid life.
surprisingly  the risk of heart artery calcification remains even if even if they maintain normal blood sugar levels after pregnancy  said co author erica p.
gunderson from kaiser permanente.
the study results appeared in circulation  journal of the american heart association.
for the study  the researchers followed approximately 1 100 women without type 1 or type 2 diabetes for 25 years which ended in 2011.
after the 25 year follow up  it was found that women who had diabetes during pregnancy had a two fold higher risk of coronary artery calcification  regardless of whether they had healthy blood sugar levels  pre diabetes or type 2 diabetes.
as many as 36 per cent women with a history of gestational diabetes in the study developed pre diabetes while 26 per cent developed type 2 diabetes  the researchers said.
how to prevent gestational diabetes  it is not fully understood as to why some women develop diabetes during pregnancy.
unfortunately  gestational diabetes can’t be prevented entirely  but the risk can be reduced by staying healthy before and during pregnancy.
to lower your risk for gestational diabetes  it is important to know the factors that can contribute to developing the condition.
below are the risk factors associated with gestational diabetes   being overweight and obese  inactive lifestyle  gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy  existing heath conditions that cause insulin resistance  such as polycystic ovarian syndrome  pcos  and the skin disorder acanthosis nigricans  having an immediate family member with type 2 diabetes  high blood pressure prior to pregnancy  excessive weight gain during a current or previous pregnancy  being pregnant with multiples  like twins or triplets  previously delivering a baby weighing more than 9 pounds  4.
1 kilograms.
women belonging to some ethnic groups such as african americans  asian americans  hispanics  native americans  pacific islanders have a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes.
so  if you’re overweight  try to lose weight before planning a baby to lower your risk for gestational diabetes.
a healthy diet combined with regular exercise is the best way to lose weight.
even if you’re not overweight  try to establish a regular physical activity – a moderate exercise for at least 30 minutes at least three times a week may help.
include a lot of vegetables  fruits  and whole grains in your diet to stay healthy and prepare your body for pregnancy.

"the budget announcements by the finance minister  made in the background of the pandemic  have largely been on expected lines expect that the fiscal deficit number has turned out to be much larger than expected.
the expectation was that the fiscal deficit in the current year would be 7.
5 per cent  which turned out to be 9.
5 per cent of gdp.
for 2021 22  the expectation is that the budget deficit will be kept around 5.
5 per cent of gdp  but the finance minister has projected a higher fiscal deficit number of 6.
8 per cent of gdp.
this increase can be attributed to the fact that the government has decided to discontinue the practice of giving loans to the food corporation of india  fci  and bring the subsidy to fci transparently in the budget number.
this has increased the deficit number by about 1 per cent.
this is  however  welcome and in the interest of fiscal transparency and data integrity.
the policy premise of the budget  which was also elaborated in the economic survey  is that the job and output multiplier effects of non defence expenditures should be harnessed without worrying about inflation and borrowing cost  especially when the global market is awash with liquidity.
based on this philosophy  capital allocation in infrastructure segment like roads  railways  shipping and petroleum has been substantially enhanced.
in order to access low cost long term pension and insurance fund  the government has also decided to create a development financial institution  dfi  for which legislation is being brought in this session of parliament.
this institution will leverage its capital to attract global funds for completion of more than 7 000 projects identified in the national infrastructure pipeline.
the second important feature of the budget is the proposed financial reforms.
here  the government has decided to bite the bullet by announcing the privatisation of two public sector banks which would require amendment to the bank nationalisation act.
this is a bold move  which was suggested by many economists as the most viable way forward.
further  the government has also decided to create a bad bank in the form of an arc  asset reconstruction company  and amc  asset management corporation  to take in its account all the npas of banks and nbfcs.
here  the design of the bad bank is important.
ideally  it should be tested in the private sector and comprise a set of specialised bad banks for sectors like real estate and power so that the management can be vested with experts who can extract the best value out of these bad assets.
third  the government has used the opportunity of the covid crisis to substantially hike the investment in the health sector from about 1.
5 per cent of gdp to 2.
5 per cent.
this is being done through a centrally sponsored health scheme named ‘prime minister atmanirbhar swasth bharat yojana’  at an outlay of ₹64 180 crore.
this amount would be used to strengthen the testing laboratories of primary health centres and other medical institutions.
this scheme is also being combined with another to improve access to water and have better sewage facilities in urban india.
this is an important initiative in the area of preventive healthcare  most of the diseases in india can be traced to poor water quality contributed by inadequate sewage facility.
the improved infrastructure will help indians reduce their out of pocket health expenditure which  at 65 per cent  is the highest in the world.
in the announcement made in part b of the budget speech  there were no major changes in the direct and indirect tax rates.
the taxation sting was at the end of the budget speech when the finance minister proposed the imposition of an agriculture infrastructure and development cess  aidc  on specified goods — including alcoholic beverages  petrol  diesel  gold  silver  cotton  peas and apple.
the emphasis on process improvement in taxation was based on the assumption that ease of paying taxes would help in tax buoyancy.
one can see in the budget proposals a determination to pursue growth even if it means a temporary fiscal slide back.
it’s hope is that more growth will lead to more jobs  reduce poverty and reverse the recent increase in debt gdp ratio.

"uti mf is launching its small cap fund at a time when ankit believes there are at least 5 drivers for wealth creation in the segment  valuations are still at long term average on p/b basis  even after the run up  and in attractive zone on dividend yield basis  on a rolling 3 yr and 5 yr returns basis  the small cap index is still more comparable to its historic lows  low interest rate environment tends to benefit smaller companies more  at the margin  formalization is gathering pace even in the small caps space – giving small cap leaders significant growth runways  when the broader economy does well – as is expected going forward – small and midcaps tend to outperform.
wf  small caps have rallied the strongest compared to mid and large caps from the march 2020 lows.
is there froth building up in this segment   ankit  if one looks at valuations  then on p/b metric  small caps are trading closer to long term averages.
in the current scenario where the earnings have significantly been disrupted  a more stable balance sheet based valuation metric would give us a better sense of the market.
on a dividend yield front  the small cap index is closer to a favorable zone.
moreover  on a rolling 3 year and 5 year returns basis  the small cap index is still more comparable to the historic lows  and nowhere close to the frothy levels we have seen in the past.
wf  small caps are seen as most vulnerable to the economic environment.
what in this context gives you room for optimism that this economic revival has firm roots and will sustain and strengthen going forward   ankit  we have observed two key trends in the recent quarterly results  significant reduction in competitive intensity as the weaker and unorganized segment gives way to the larger organized players even in the small cap segment.
as a philosophy  we invest a significant part of the portfolio in companies that are leaders in their niche segment and benefit from similar market share consolidation trends that we have observed in some of the larger cap companies.
secondly  we have seen that the companies have undergone a lot of cost cutting and have reduced a lot of fixed overheads  a part of which might be structural.
this  combined with a benign monetary policy  would mean that there is a high probability of earnings expansion going ahead.
that could drive the next leg of the rally for the small cap segment  especially for some of the small cap leaders.
wf  in the indicative sectoral preferences shared in your presentation  you propose to be overweight consumer goods and marginally underweight industrial manufacturing.
are you on balance tilting towards defensives rather than cyclicals   ankit  we primarily have a bottom up approach to investing and don t look at taking overweight and under weight positions in sectors and then look for stocks within them.
we try to identify companies with a long runway of growth that can compound their earnings over time or look for companies that may be going through a turnaround from a temporary disruption and hence are poised for mean reversion.
our sectoral exposure is primarily a summation of various bottom up exposures.
wf  in the last 8 months  the biggest outperformers in small caps have been chemicals  pharma and it.
you plan to be neutral weight on chemicals while the other two don t find mention in your top sectoral bets.
do you think the best is already behind for these sectors   ankit  our approach is again bottom up in nature and size our positions in the portfolio based on both the relative conviction in a stock based on fundamentals and also the market depth with respect to the stock.
the sectoral weights that we see do not necessarily convey our confidence in the sector.
it may so happen that while we may like a sector we may not have the right opportunities to play it thru the small and midcap space.
individual position sizing is where we take care of long term growth and valuations when taking exposures.
in some of the sectors mentioned above  the valuations have moved up and hence from a risk management perspective  it would get reflected in individual stock exposures taken.
wf  some experts believe its time for old economy stocks to shine – including metals  mining  engineering  auto  infra.
what is your take on the old vs new economy debate in terms of wealth creation potential   ankit  in our investment approach  we invest around 60 70  of the portfolio in high quality companies with a long runway of growth.
we also invest a part of the portfolio around 30 40  in turnaround opportunities that benefit from mean reversion playing out for businesses going through a temporary phase of disruption.
we believe some of the auto  engineering and metals space exposures would benefit from the cyclcial upturn in the economy and form part of this turnaround bucket in our portfolio.
wf  from here on  between large  mid and small caps  which segment do you see outperforming over the next 3 years and why   ankit  if we look at the past three years  performance  then small caps and midcaps have underperformed the large cap peers.
from a valuation perspective  also the small and midcaps are better placed as compared to their larger cap peers.
in a low interest rate environment  at the margin  the smaller cap companies tend to benefit more as they can gain benefit from a lower cost of capital.
moreover  the trends that we have seen of higher formalization in the small cap space  if continues then it would lead to significant earnings recovery  and that would drive the outperformance of mid and small caps.
when the broader economy does well  the small and midcaps tend to outperform.

"buying more disposable income houses by lower taxation is an expensive deal  especially in urban areas.
for this large amount should be borrowed.
according to bankbazaar s figures  the average ticket size for home loan has been 26.
67 lakh rupees for home loan.
such a large borrowing squeezed your income.
the critical situations of the year 2020 have made it difficult.
income tax law offers a tax deduction  deduction  for the necessary expenses such as home loan payments  healthcare expenses  insurance premiums and school fees.
there is no way to avoid these expenses  and therefore  they need to be able to make deductible with inflation  inflation.
when this is done by giving more discount in income for home ownership  it will promote more disposable income  which is very important benefit for this time.
existing deductions are not enough  existing deductions seem insufficient.
for example  on an average loan of 35 lakh rupees for 20 years at 8   the interest of the first year will be 2.
77 lakh rupees.
it is obvious that this amount is more than the current limit of rs 2 lakh under section 24b.
remember that for the landlord it is a compulsory and can not be avoided.
if the landlord gets the facility of claiming a deduction for an additional amount of rs 77 000  then it can save taxes up to rs 24 000 in a year   about rs 2 000 in a month.
this is the money which can be used for discretry expenses and which will eventually speed up the economy.
at present  many currents at this time  can be taken under section 80c  rs 1.
5 lakh on the principal  and section 24 lakhs on the home loan  2 lakh rupees at interest.
along with this  the facility of deduction of interest is also available under section 80 ee  rs 50 000  and 80 eea  1.
5 lakh rupees  for eligible borrowers.
they can be streamlined only one stream for the deduction of home loan  which is up to 5 lakhs without any sub limit for principal and interest.
if the existing limit  obtained under section 80c  24 b and eea   it will be equal to a limit of rs 5 lakh.
some deductions are discriminatory at this time some deductions are discriminatory.
by streamlecting relief streams on home loan  it will end up discrimination in 80 ee and 80 eea.
its benefit can only be those who buy the house for the first time  which buy a fixed size property.
with this  many people are deprived of whose first assets do not fit in the square foot or time limit outlined in these streams  or they are also deprived of which they want to buy a big house for their big family  or those who the city is changing for professional reasons  they do not get the facility of tax concession  tax brakes  on the purchase of another home.
",budget 2021  increased discounts in income tax on home loan
"the budget for fiscal year 22 was quite realistic in most cases.
the focus was on capital expenditure which has increased by 26  compared to fiscal year 2021  the excitement of watching a budget day speech for most market participants is as exciting as celebrating a birthday.
depending on who’s watching the budget  the adrenaline rush points vary   for bond market players too  there is  among other things  a single point watch – just like the way arjuna was focused on the bird’s eye in the mahabharata.
that single point for bond market participants was the budget deficit figure as a percentage of gdp for india.
this number is significant because unlike many parts of the western world  india’s budget deficit is almost entirely funded by captive funds.
also  this fy 2202 budget was presented in the middle of the vaccination period or the year of hope.
therefore  the palpitation was understandable.
so what did the market do with the budget figures presented this time around   the budget for fiscal year 22 was quite realistic in most cases.
the focus was on capital spending  which increased by 26  compared to fiscal 2021.
emphasis was placed on infrastructure and the bfsi sector with an emphasis on healthcare as well.
although there is awareness of being financially responsible over time  for fy22 the total budget deficit was set at 6.
8  of gdp – signaling an increase in borrowing in the market to finance investments.
the fiscal assumptions have also been quite modest  in line with nominal gdp growth  and can be seen as positive as economic growth picks up.
while the stock markets appreciated this move  a government bond offering of an additional rs 80 000 cr for fy21 scared bond yields  up about 15bp in bond yields.
the gross borrowing for fy 22 is pegged at 12 lakh inr crore – which is higher than the markets expected.
as a result  yields have risen across the curve  particularly on the mid and long ends of the yield curve.
liquidity in the banking system remains comfortable  so overnight rates can continue to follow the reverse repos rate for now.
the current yield curve is too steep  which strengthens the case to drive out carry in fixed income as opposed to capital gains.
all eyes are now on rbi’s mpc to point a way forward.
with the comfort of inflation  the reduction in gold imports  the inr stable to appreciate  we think it is too premature to remove the accommodation bias on interest rates.
we expect a status quo  therefore a long pause may continue.
the key to watch out for is an indication of omo continuity – a necessary ingredient if long term returns are to be kept under control.
at the moment  the additional borrowing of inr rs 80 000 cr is certainly unforeseen and with a low appetite it is difficult to see the auction go through without an increase in yield.
for investors  it is better to stick to the planned investment horizons as volatility would continue to be the order of the day.

"google ने कुछ समय पहले भारत में pixel 4a लॉन्च किया है.
pixel फैंस थोड़े निराश दिखे  क्योंकि कंपनी ने pixel 5 भारत में लॉन्च नहीं किया.
google ने हालाँकि इस बार pixel 4a की क़ीमत कंट्रोल में रखी है.
ये ज़्यादा महँगा नहीं है और इसे मिड रेंज स्मार्टफ़ोन कहा जा सकता है.
फ़ोन को मैंने यूज किया है और इस आधार पर इसका रिव्यू बताते हैं.
pixel 4a के साथ सबसे अच्छी बात ये है कि अगर आप इसे एक हाथ से यूज कर सकते हैं.
फ़ोन पतला है  हल्का है और काफ़ी हैंडी.
यहाँ तक की कई बार ये फ़ोन नहीं किसी खिलौने जैसा लगता है.
pixel 4a   डिजाइन  फ़ोन पीछे से मैट ब्लैक फिनिश वाला लगता है और इसके रियर पैनल पर सिंगल कैमरा सेटअप दिया गया है.
बॉडी पॉलीकार्बोनेट की है और डिज़ाइन में कुछ क्रांतिकारी नहीं है.
हालाँकि देखने में ऐसा लगता है कि इसमें दो कैमरे होंगे  क्योंकि यहाँ स्क्वॉयर शेप दिया गया है.
सिंगल कैमरा और एलईडी फ़्लैश है.
फ़िंगरप्रिंट स्कैनर भी पीछे ही दिया गया है और नीचे की तरफ़ गूगल की ब्रांडिंग है.
फ़ोन के बॉटम में स्पीकर ग्रिल के साथ usb type c पोर्ट दिया गया है.
दाईं तरफ वॉल्यूम रॉकर कीज़ और पावर बटन दिया गया है.
हमेशा की तरह गूगल ने इस बार भी पावर बटन बॉडी से हट कर लाइट कलर का दिया गया है.
फ़ोन बिना कवर यूज करने में मज़ा आएगा.
स्क्रैच आसानी से नहीं लगते हैं और ये स्लिपरी भी नहीं है  हाथ से आसानी से नहीं गिरेगा और ग्रिप भी अच्छी बनी रहेगी.
फ़ोन में हेडफ़ोन भी दिया गया है और ओवरऑल ये फ़ोन बेहद कॉम्पैक्ट और ड्यूरेबल दिखता है.
इस बार कंपनी ने pixel 4a में नॉच कम देने की कोशिश की है.
लेकिन फिर भी चिन और ऊपर की तरफ़ पतले बेजल्स दिए गए हैं.
डिस्प्ले के लिए oled पैनल का इस्तेमाल किया गया है.
pixel 4a डिस्प्ले  डिस्प्ले साइज़ 5.
81 का oled डिस्प्ले है और ये फ़ुल एचडी प्लस है.
एचडीआर का सपोर्ट भी दिया गया है.
इससे पहले तक के पिक्सल स्मार्टफोन्स में बेजल्स होते थे  लेकिन इसे बेजल लेस कहा जा सकता है.
प्रोटेक्शन के लिए इसमें corning gorilla glass 3 दिया गया है जो अब पुराना हो चुका है.
कंपनी को नए वर्जन का गोरिल्ला ग्लास लगाना चाहिए था.
बहरहाल फ़ोन यूज करने में इसकी डिस्प्ले काफ़ी शानदार लगती है.
डिस्प्ले ब्राइट और कलरफुल है  एमडीआर बेस्ड ott कंटेंट बढ़िया से देख सकते हैं  लेकिन डिस्प्ले छोटी होने की वजह से आप शायद इस पर फ़िल्में देखने प्रेशर न करें.
ऑलवेज ऑन डिस्प्ले का फ़ीचर दिया गया है.
यहां आपको बैटरी लेवल  टाइम और दूसरी ज़रूरी जानकारियाँ दिखाई देती हैं.
पुराने पिक्सल की तरह इसमें भी म्यूजिक डिटेक्शन ऑन कर सकते हैं.
यानी कोई गाना चल रहा है तो इसे आपका फ़ोन डिटेक्ट करके ऑलवेज ऑन डिस्प्ले पर शो करेगा.
ओवरऑल फोन की डिस्प्ले अच्छा है और मैंने ज़्यादातर इसे डार्क मोड पर यूज किया है.
कुछ लाइव वॉलपेपर्स शानदार हैं जो रियलटाइम होते हैं.
पिक्सल ख़रीदे तो इसे आप ज़रूर ट्राई करें.
pixel 4a कैमरा  google pixel को काफ़ी पहले से बेहतर कैमरा फ़ोन कहा जाता है.
चूँकि कंपनी ने एक ही सेंसर दे कर पहले भी लोगों को फोटॉग्रफी के मामले में चौंकाया है.
बेहतर क्वॉलिटी फ़ोटोज  पोर्ट्रेट मोड और नाइट मोड के मामले में इसका कोई तोड़ नहीं रहा है.
इंप्रेसिव ये है कि एक तरफ़ कंपनियाँ तीन  चार और पाँच कैमरे दे रही हैं वहीं कंपनी एक कैमरे और सॉफ़्टवेयर के बदौलत शानदार फ़ोटोज़ दे रहा है.
इस फ़ोन के साथ थोड़ा पर्सेप्शन बदलेगा  शायद.
pixel 4a के रियर में 12.
2 मेगापिक्सल का कैमरा है  जबकि फ़्रंट में 8 मेगापिक्सल का कैमरा है.
इस दौर में मुझे नहीं लगता इस क़ीमत पर किसी दूसरे स्मार्टफोन्स में सिर्फ़ एक रियर कैमरा दिया जा रहा है.
लेकिन क्या एक कैमरा ही दूसरों पर भारी पड़ता है   इस कैमरे से आप 4k वीडियो 30fps पर शूट कर सकते हैं.
फ़ोटो क्लिक करना आसान और फ़ास्ट है.
चूँकि लेंस एक ही इसलिए आपको पास अलग अलग लेंस को यूज करने के लिए उस तरह से मोड्स भी नहीं हैं.
पोर्ट्रेट शॉट एक कैमरे के बावजूद हमेशा की तरह पिक्सल फ़ोन में शानदार है.
डेप्थ सेंसिंग लेंस की कमी जरा भी नहीं खलती है.
वाइड एंगल लेंस की कमी पूरी तरह से आपको खलेगी.
मैक्रो फोटॉग्रफी भी करते हैं तो इसमें मैक्रो लेंस नहीं है और इसकी भी कमी महसूस हो सकती है.
लेकिन ज़्यादा नहीं होगी  क्योंकि नज़दीक से फ़ोटोज़ अच्छी आती हैं.
क्लिक की गई तस्वीरों में बाद में भी आप बैकग्राउंड ब्लर या बोके इफ़ेक्ट डाल सकते हैं.
नॉर्मल आउटडोर फोटॉग्रफी सॉलिड है और बेहतरीन तस्वीरें क्लिक कर सकते हैं.
फ़ोटोज़ में पर्याप्त डीटेल्स होते हैं और ख़ास बात ये है कि फ़ोटोज बनावटी नहीं लगेंगी.
नाइट साइट मोड गूगल पिक्सल की ख़ासियत रही है और दूसरी कंपनियों ने यहाँ से काफ़ी कुछ कॉपी किया है.
अंधेरे में आर्टिफिशियल इंटेलिजेंस के बदौलत अच्छी तस्वीरें क्लिक कर सकते हैं.
थोड़ा सब्र रखने की ज़रूरत होगी.
सिंगल कैमरा होने की वजह से आपको यहाँ ऑप्टिकल और हाईब्रिड ज़ूम भी नहीं मिलते हैं.
हालांकि आप 7x तक डिजिटल ज़ूम कर सकते हैं  लेकिन ये किसी ख़ास काम का नहीं है.
ओवरऑल इस सेग्मेंट में एक सिंगल कैमरा होने के बावजूद ये स्मार्टफ़ोन फोटॉग्रफी के लिहाज़ से अच्छा है.
फ़ोटोज़ क्लिक करना आसान है  फ़ास्ट है और इसमें कुछ मोड्स दिए गए हैं जो आपके लिए बेहद फ़ायदेमंद है.
फ़ोटोज़ ज़ूम करने पर पिक्सलेट नहीं होंगी  नाइट साइट मोड में क्लिक की गई तस्वीरों में आपको ज़्यादा ग्रेन्स नहीं दिखेंगे.
कम रौशनी में भी आप अच्छी फोटॉग्रफी कर सकेंगे.
google pixel 4a   परफ़ॉर्मेंस   सॉफ़्टवेयर  pixel 4a में qualcomm snapdragon 730 प्रोसेसर दिया गया है और इसमें 6gb रैम है.
इंटर्नल स्टोरेज 128gb की है.
गूगल फोटोज में हाई क्वॉलिटी इमेज अनलिमिटेड अपलोड कर सकते हैं.
गूगल ने हाल ही में हाई क्वॉलिटी इमेज अपलोड पर 15gb की लिमिट लगा दी है जो अगले साल से लागू होगा.
लेकिन pixel के साथ अच्छी बात ये है कि हाई क्वॉलिटी फ़ोटोज़ आगे भी आप अनलिमिटेड क्लाउड पर अपलोड कर सकेंगे.
google pixel 4a में android 11 दिया गया है और ये शानदार है.
गूगल ने अपने पिक्सल स्मार्टफ़ोन में सॉफ़्टवेयर को इतनी ख़ूबसूरती से सिंक किया है जो वाकई क़ाबिले तारीफ़ है.
सॉफ़्टवेयर बेस्ड कई फ़ीचर्स हैं pixel 4a में जो आपको दूसरे एंड्रॉयड स्मार्टफोन्स में नहीं मिलेंगे.
ऑडियो में आप रियल टाइम सबटाइटल ऐड कर सकते हैं.
इसके साथ ही आप कॉल ट्रांसक्रिप्ट का भी फ़ीचर दिया गया है.
ये सटीक है   बहरहाल सॉफ़्टवेयर के अलावा परफ़ॉर्मेंस के लिहाज़ से भले ही इसमें मिड रेंज प्रोसेसर है  लेकिन फिर भी ये आपको निराश नहीं करेगा.
गेमिंग के लिए ये प्रैक्टिकल फ़ोन नहीं है  क्योंकि इसकी स्क्रीन छोटी है तो आपको उतना मज़ा नहीं आएगा.
गेमिंग कर सकते हैं और हेवी गेम भी चलेंगे  लेकिन अगर आप गेमर्स हैं तो शायद ये फ़ोन आपके लिए नहीं है.
इसमें स्टॉक एंड्रॉयड है यानी पहले से इंस्टॉल किए गए ऐप्स नहीं मिलेंगे और ये सबसे अच्छी बात है.
जेस्चर कंट्रोल अच्छा काम करता है और ये फ़ास्ट है.
गूगल असिस्टेंट भी स्मूद और फ़ास्ट काम करता है.
फ़ोन फ़ास्ट और स्मूद है  गर्म नहीं होगा  मल्टी टास्किंग आराम से कर सकते हैं.
एक ऐप से दूसरे ऐप में स्विच करना फ़ास्ट है  लोडिंग टाइम कम है.
सॉफ़्टवेयर मक्खन की तरह काम करता है.
हेवी यूज में ये स्मार्टफ़ोन कई बार थोड़ा फीका पड़ता है और यहीं हाई एंड प्रोसेसर की कमी खलती है.
इसमें 5g का भी सपोर्ट नहीं है यानी फ़ोन फ्यूचर रेडी नहीं है.
अगर भारत में 2021 या 2022 तक 5g आ गया तो आपको फ़ोन बदलने की ज़रूरत होगी.
pixel 4a   बैटरी बैकअप  pixel 4a में 3 100mah की बैटरी दी गई है और ये 18w फास्ट चार्ज सपोर्ट करता है.
ऑलवेज ऑन डिस्प्ले ऐक्टिवेट रखने के बाद आप इसे मिक्स्ड यूज में पूरे दिन आराम से चला सकेंगे.
ऑलवेज ऑन डिस्प्ले ऑफ रख कर आप इससे ज़्यादा बैकअप निकाल सकते हैं.
कंपनी हालाँकि दावा किया था कि फ़ुल चार्ज करके 24 घंटे तक चला सकेंगे.
लेकिन हमारे रिव्यू में ऐसा नहीं हो पाया है.
ओवरऑल बैटरी बैकअप इस फ़ोन की डीसेंट है  लेकिन और बेहतर की जा सकती थी.
पिछले पिक्सल के मुक़ाबले ये निश्चित तौर पर ज़्यादा बैकअप देता है.
बॉटम लाइन  pixel 4a   पिक्सल के फ़ैन हैं तो फिर आपको किसी तरह का रिव्यू शायद ही आपको ये स्मार्टफ़ोन ख़रीदने से रोक पाए.
लेकिन अगर आप मार्केट देख कर तय करेंगे तो इस लिहाज़ से इस फ़ोन में कुछ कमियाँ ज़रूर दिखेंगे.
बावजूद इसके  pixel 4a इस सेग्मेंट का एक अच्छा कैमरा फ़ोन है.
परफ़ॉर्मेंस अच्छा है और चूँकि फ़ोन काफ़ी कॉम्पैक्ट है  इसलिए यूज करने में काफ़ी मज़ा आएगा.
गूगल का प्योर सॉफ़्टवेयर एक्सपिरिएंस चाहिए तो ऐसे में भी ये फ़ोन आपके लिए बेहतर रहेगा.

billy sharp appeared to push david de gea as bryan scored and harry maguire was adjudged to have fouled goalkeeper aaron ramsdale before martial found the net — decisions the united boss says he has had confirmed were wrong.

"national postdoctoral association applauds pay increases for postdocs  send2press newswire2021 02 01  rockville  md.
feb 01  2021  send2press newswire     as advocates for a rewarding postdoctoral experience  the national postdoctoral association  npa  applauds the national institutes of health  nih  for increasing the ruth l.
kirschstein national research service award  nrsa  stipends for fiscal year 2021.
a bellwether for research institutions across the country  nrsa pay levels are a critical factor in setting salaries for postdoctoral scholars   postdocs   of all disciplines.
we can empower and educate the entire postdoctoral community by integrating meaningful work with healthy personal lives   commented thomas p.
kimbis  npa executive director and ceo.
a reasonable salary is a necessary part of any well integrated postdoc experience.
postdocs are the heart of early stage research across america.
having completed their doctoral or terminal degrees in their fields  roughly 70 000 postdocs across all fifty states tackle tough issues in all disciplines from the biological and social sciences to engineering  leading cutting edge research efforts at universities  institutes and within industry.
often the unsung heroes in american research  thousands of postdocs have worked tirelessly during the covid 19 pandemic to improve outcomes in the fight against the virus  from developing vaccines to understanding the impact of the pandemic on schools and communities.
postdocs not only serve as leaders of research projects  but also as important mentors and respected role models for graduate students  keeping the american innovation pipeline flowing.
during this unprecedented time in our nation s history  the dedication and acumen of the hidden postdoctoral workforce is imperative  which makes this intentional expression of appreciation ever more important   remarked stephanie k.
eberle  m.
ed.
npa board chair.
the npa is heartened by the nih s track record of increases in nrsa stipends and encourages the nih to continue to provide annual adjustments to ensure that postdocs are empowered  valued  recognized  and supported in their lives and work as they well deserve.
about national postdoctoral association     the npa is a charitable and educational non profit association headquartered in rockville  maryland  that seeks to improve the postdoctoral experience by supporting a culture of enhanced professional growth.
at the individual  organizational  and national levels  the npa facilitates connections  raises awareness  and collaborates with stakeholders in the postdoctoral community.

"london  feb 1  pti  the commonwealth journalists association  cja  on monday urged the indian government to honour its international commitments to the commonwealth and the united nations and ensure that the media is free to play its constitutional role as a guardian of the public interest and in holding elected governments to account.
the cja  a 43 year old organisation advocating press freedom  called on the relevant authorities to withdraw the first information reports  firs  issued against leading editors and journalists for their coverage of the farmers’ protest in delhi on january 26.
the cja is particularly alarmed at the use of laws pertaining to sedition and criminal conspiracy against journalists who were simply doing their job  reporting events as they happened.
many of these laws are of colonial origin and in urgent need of reform   reads the cja statement.
the cja urges the government to act firmly to protect those journalists who face harassment online and offline  death threats  violence and even assassination in the course of their work and to end the impunity enjoyed by their attackers.
india’s reputation as the world’s largest democracy is increasingly at risk as cases of arbitrary arrests and prosecutions multiply   it adds.
the statement is the latest from journalists  groups after farmers  protests in delhi turned violent on the republic day when protesters broke into the red fort complex resulting in one death and hundreds of injuries.
journalists are among those arrested or facing charges in relation to the protests against the government s proposed agricultural reforms.
congress mp shashi tharoor and the six journalists    mrinal pande  rajdeep sardesai  vinod jose  zafar agha  paresh nath and anant nath    have been booked by police  including in bjp ruled states such as uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh  over their allegedly misleading tweets on the violence during the farmers  tractor rally in delhi on republic day.
freelance journalist mandeep punia and dharmender singh  with online news india  were detained by delhi police sunday evening for allegedly misbehaving with personnel on duty.
while singh was later released  the police arrested punia on sunday.

"in the wake of the mini budgets presented last year  and responding to the clarion call for atmanirbharta  self reliance  by pm modi  it was no surprise that budget 2021 focused on economic recovery and job creation  on health and well being  capital and infrastructure  inclusive development  reinvigorating human capital  innovation and r d  and minimum government and maximum governance.
it was a very pleasant surprise to see the fm present the first digital budget from a made in india tablet  which bears testimony to the government’s deep commitment to tech adoption and support for indian players.
against the backdrop of an expanded fiscal deficit because of the pandemic and a need for fiscal consolidation  it is to the government’s credit that direct taxes have remained largely unchanged.
inasmuch  compliance burden has been significantly eased.
for instance  national faceless income tax appellate tribunal centre is to be set up to enable digital communication with appellants.
corporate affairs mac21 portal version 3.
0 and nclt will leverage regulatory tech for e scrutiny  e adjudication  and compliance management.
reduction in period for re opening of income tax returns has been brought down from six years to three.
in addition  the budget has provided clarifications relating to the imposition of equalisation levy  el  as not being applicable to transactions subject to income tax.
it has also provided tax incentives for relocating foreign funds in the international financial services center  ifsc   and to allow tax exemption to the investment division of foreign banks located in ifsc.
with the world’s largest vaccination drive under way  a massive boost in healthcare spending was on the cards.
to be sure  a 137 per cent increase in budget allocation over the previous year is a substantial push.
with an overall outlay of ₹64 180 crore for healthcare programmes in addition to the national health mission  and ₹35 000 crore earmarked for covid 19 vaccination  it should be a major step forward in preventative and curative healthcare in india.
this is also a sector where start ups are deeply focussed and we saw some incredible breakthroughs over the last year levered on cutting edge technologies.
boost for innovators  speaking of start ups  this year’s budget had some positive announcements while recognising their contribution to the economy.
the definition of start ups has been expanded to include companies with paid up capital and turnover up to ₹2 crore and ₹20 crore  respectively.
the government will also incentivise the incorporation of one person companies  opc.
this is a boost for innovators because such companies can grow without restriction on paid up capital and turnover  and can convert into any other company type at any time.
the residency status of an indian citizen for setting up an opc has been reduced from 182 to 120 days.
it also allows nris to incorporate opcs in india.
moreover  the burden of taxation has been reduced — start ups can get capital gains exemption for one more year and extend their tax holiday up to march 31  2022.
however  no better timing than now for some disruptive reforms for this sector.
we urge the government to seriously consider some of our asks like the extension of available tax holiday of three years to all start ups registered under dpiit  which will positively impact over 40k start ups and taxation of esops at the time the sale of share.
these steps can have a huge impact on the segment.
disruptive reforms  also  given the increasing importance of domestic funding  it is high time the government reduced the long term capital gains tax in the hands of resident investors to 10 per cent and provide them with a level playing field with non resident investors.
wanting to strengthen the nation’s innovation   research focus  there was an announcement of an outlay of 50k crore inr over 5 years.
this can and should be read in conjunction with a few other things.
the national translation mission  for one.
a massive amount of governance   policy related information in regional language can be disseminated once this mission takes shape.
yet another is the budget allocation for post education training and the proposal to amend apprenticeship law.
also 1.
5k crore inr has been allocated to promote digital mode of payments which also circles back to another announcement – setting up a world class fintech hub in gujarat international financial tech city.
the point is  whether india can become a fintech hub or bridge the knowledge gap with  bharat  or develop relevant talent will depend on our ability to innovate and make solutions available to the masses at affordable price points.
the budget did miss one key opportunity for accelerating growth and jobs.
india’s ites companies have played a major role in economic recovery and going forward in a hybrid world  they will continue to be pivotal.
the future of work and workplace has changed.
towards addressing this new hybrid operating model  we had suggested a few recommendations  direct   indirect taxes  and requested clarification on the sez policy.
we remain hopeful that during the year  some of these recommendations will be suitably addressed as the government remains focused on increased digitisation to put the economy back on a fast growth track.

"hours after finance minister nirmala sitharaman’s budget speech  principal economic advisor sanjeev sanyal spoke exclusively to moneycontrol.
sanyal said the aim of the budget was to bet on long term growth through public spending.
when you save your spending for infrastructure  it s not one year  you re betting on a period of time   sanyal said.
sanyal justified the finance minister’s decision to not provide tax breaks for the salaried classes.
if anything  we have invested into simplifying a lot of tax procedures  particularly for the old  making sure that concerns about investigations are allayed   he said.
follow moneycontrol s budget 2021 live coverage  the focus was on growth and creating jobs when there are concerns about job security  he said.
excerpts   we have gone for growth  that should be pretty obvious.
and i think the context in which it needs to be seen is obviously the impact of the pandemic.
there was a lot of criticism about india  india s approach to it  which was very different from what many of the experts or what other countries were doing.
we did not go for a big  upfront big bang  stimulus.
instead  we first went for the world s tightest lockdown.
we took a minus 24 percent gdp  gross domestic product  growth rate on the chin.
and even after that  once the economy was opened up  we did step by step ramping up.
by the last quarter of the calendar year  which is the october to december quarter  there were very significant increases in capital expenditure.
so  october was up 129 percent year on year  and 249 percent year on year in november and 62 percent in december.
january numbers will be similarly quite large.
and then we are again going for a fairly heavy infrastructure rollout over the next couple of years.
when you save your spending for infrastructure  it s not one year  you re betting on a period of time.
and our argument is that this is a good time to do it.
at least for the next year  our nominal gdp growth rate will be somewhere in the 15 percent plus range  according to our  economic survey 2020 21  calculations.
the budget  though  has been conservative at 14 percent.
also read  fm nirmala sitharaman opens government purse strings to revive growth  we will then be able to sustain it even from a fiscal consolidation perspective because nominal interest rates are so much lower than the nominal gdp growth rate.
absolutely.
so initially  when the lockdown was on  the targeting was on providing basic essential services  and cushions and a safety net to the vulnerable sections of society.
that s why we rolled out the world s largest food program  we had all those guarantee schemes and other things for msmes and so on.
as we come out of that we have also now we are targeting infrastructure.
because this is the thing that provides the biggest multiplier for demand and jobs.
and it also leaves behind assets.
even when the fiscal deficit declines next year  there ll still be borrowing to do.
so we are using this to create assets  which we will leave for future generations.
so this is an important part of it  both the timing part of it and the targeting part of it.
some wanted a big upfront  broad sort of spending while we were under lockdown.
others  till very recently recommended a tax the rich kind of an approach.
we avoided all of that and we have gone for a very particular approach.
we have targeted infrastructure spending and on health.
it s not just physical infrastructure but also things like health education  we are creating a national research foundation.
meanwhile  we are also rejigging the banking system and priming it for expansion in multiple ways  including creating our development finance institution.
obviously  it s their call  i can t comment.
we did write in the economic survey  however  that given our economic fundamentals  we are rated way below what is justified by our fundamentals.
i think we would rather grow and go for growth than worry about this particular issue  given the context that the fiscal standing of virtually every other country who is rated above us is now going to be significantly worse than ours.
it s not a bad bank of the kind that bifr  board for industrial and financial reconstruction  was.
it will be run basically by the banks  for the banks kind of a thing.
but yes  the government will provide support in whatever way it can.
but the details will really come through from the banking secretary  so just bear with us.
the expectation was in fact that taxes would be going up and then nothing went up.
if anything  we have invested in simplifying a lot of tax procedures  particularly for the old  making sure that concerns about investigations are allayed.
so i think in a time when there were a lot of concerns about job security  we have gone for growth  trying to re employ people.
i think that was the more sensible thing to do.

louis  eric lenze  /prnewswire/    the covid early treatment fund  cetf  www.
treatearly.
org announced today that the medical journalpublished a report that outlines the success in using a generic drug  fluvoxamine  to prevent complications of covid 19.
this real world evidence study provides additional independent confirmation that fluvoxamine is highly effective in preventing hospitalization and death from covid    said  a silicon valley high tech entrepreneur and the founder of cetf  a charitable organization that funds outpatient trials of existing drugs.
repurposed drugs always have had the potential to be the fastest and least expensive way out of this pandemic.
in this study  fluvoxamine was again shown to be 100  effective in the early treatment of covid.
the report by dr.
ceo of enable biosciences and a reviewer for the national institutes of health  and dr.
a professor and infectious disease physician scientist at theschool of medicine  discusses the real world experience of using fluvoxamine to treat workers after a covid 19 outbreak in november and december at golden gate fields  a  horse racing track.
dr.
seftel  the track physician  offered fluvoxamine to infected employees after learning about the 100  success rate in avoiding hospitalization in a phase 2 randomized controlled trial published on  in the journal of the american medical association.
none of the 77 employees at golden gate fields who opted to take fluvoxamine required hospitalization  compared with a 12.
5  hospitalization rate for the 48 employees who declined the drug.
in addition  after two weeks  none of the treatment group had any covid symptoms while 60  of the group who declined the drug had one or more covid symptoms.
this is one of the most extraordinary therapeutic effects i ve witnessed in my 25 years of practicing medicine    said dr.
seftel.
there is no doubt in my mind that fluvoxamine significantly helped the workers at golden gates fields battle this virus.
in every case  respiratory decline reversed within about three days after starting the drug.
the paper states   overall  fluvoxamine appears promising as early treatment for covid 19 to prevent clinical deterioration requiring hospitalization and to prevent possible long haul symptoms persisting beyond 2 weeks.
dr.
boulware previously led the randomized clinical trial in which hydroxychloroquine was shown to be ineffective as a treatment for covid 19.
the golden gate fields experience with fluvoxamine confirmed earlier findings from a 152 patient randomized clinical trial at theschool of medicine in.
in that outpatient trial  dr.
and colleagues found that fluvoxamine was 100  effective in preventing respiratory deterioration that normally would require hospitalization compared with an 8.
3  hospitalization rate in the placebo group.
fluvoxamine  an antidepressant  is in the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  which work by increasing levels of serotonin within the brain.
lenze said the benefits of taking fluvoxamine appear to greatly outweigh any risks.
a good way of thinking about ssri risk is like if you took an aspirin a day for two weeks    he said.
it is benign  but if you happened to get in a car accident or have a bad fall in those two weeks  you d be more prone to bleed.
but if ssris help against covid  their benefits far outweigh any risks.
no medication is 100  safe  but these are pretty close.
cetf is funding a phase 3 clinical trial to examine the efficacy of using fluvoxamine for the early treatment of covid.
the trial began in december and is recruiting volunteers.

"highlights oneplus nord n1 5g has been tipped for launch.
the nord n1 5g could launch in the second half of the year.
oneplus nord n1 5g will succeed the nord 10 5g.
oneplus entered a new market segment with its nord series of devices last year.
the series brought with itself the original nord and the more affordable nord n10 and n100 smartphones.
now  reports suggest the company could add to the list this year by launching a new phone  the oneplus nord n1 5g.
the phone has been tipped for launch by reliable tipster max jambor.
the upcoming smartphone is interestingly being tipped to launch later this year as a successor to the oneplus nord n10 5g that went official in europe and the us.
while the report does not reveal any information about the specifications of the device  it does add that it could launch after the oneplus 9  9 pro  and 9e smartphones.
as such  the tipster also suggests that we might have to wait a while for the launch of the oneplus n1 5g.
however  considering that the oneplus nord n10 5g was launched in october 2020  it can be expected that the oneplus n1 5g also follows a similar launch timeline this year.
even as we wait for the launch of oneplus nord n1 5g  the company is first scheduled to launch the oneplus 9 series in india in mid march.
for now  the expectation is the oneplus 9 series will bring with itself the oneplus 9  oneplus 9 pro and another oneplus 9 lite model.
the first two are tipped to be powered by the new qualcomm snapdragon 888 chipset  while the latter could be powered by the snapdragon 870 soc.
of the three  the flagships are the most interesting.
the latest round of leaks reveals the oneplus 9 and 9 pro will come with a 3.
8mm punch hole positioned at their upper left corner with the former getting a 6.
55 inch flat panel capable of full hd resolution and a 120hz refresh rate.
the pro model is expected to be equipped with a of 6.
78 inches curved edge display which will offer a quad hd  resolution and a 120hz refresh rate.
as per reports  oneplus 9 and 9 pro will weigh less than 200 grams with the oneplus 9 tipped to sport a slim profile of 8mm  while the pro variant could come measuring 8.
5mm in thickness.
previously  we ve seen reports about the oneplus 9 s camera module which is being said to be heroed by a 50 megapixel lens.
as per a report on slashleaks  the phone will feature a three camera system  the mainstay of which will be a 50 megapixel ultra vision wide angle camera with f/1.
9 aperture.
the leak also reveals that this lens will be coupled with a 20 megapixel cine camera  an ultrawide lens with f/1.
8 aperture.
as for the third lens in the setup  there will be an ois assisted 12 megapixel telephoto camera with autofocus and an f/3.
4 aperture.
reports also say that the phone maker is set to partner with leica for the oneplus 9 series.
as per a well known tipster  teme  rodent950  multiple phone makers are partnering with leica to bring their cameras on their phones  and apparently  one of them is the oneplus.

"new delhi  the delhi high court monday sought to know whether us based e commerce giant amazon and kishore biyani led future retail ltd  frl  were open to resolving the issue arising out of rs 24 713 crore deal between frl and reliance retail.
the counsel for both  amazon and future group  submitted that they would seek instructions and inform the court on tuesday.
the court was hearing a plea by amazon seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by singapore’s emergency arbitrator  ea  restraining frl from going ahead with its rs 24 713 crore deal with reliance retail.
amazon.
com nv investment holdings llc  in its plea  also sought detention of the biyanis  directors of future coupons pvt ltd  fcpl  and frl and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged  wilful disobedience  of the emergency arbitrator’s order.
justice j r midha asked the parties to inform it on tuesday if any such endeavour could be made and clarified that this should not be taken as deferring the proceedings and it would continue as scheduled.
the court  which asked if any attempt has been made to resolve the issue  suggested that if parties would be willing  it can refer the matter to two retired judges of the supreme court.
the court also said it will consider whatever protective order can be passed.
in commercial matters  it is always helpful to find a solution  it said.
to this  senior advocate gopal subramanium  representing amazon  said he will take instructions on it as nothing tangible has happened.
senior advocate darius khambata  representing frl  also said he will take instructions and inform the court.
amazon has approached the high court seeking to restrain kishore biyani led future group from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the mukesh dhirubhai ambani  mda  group.
it also sought to restrain future group from taking any steps to transfer or dispose of frl’s retail assets or the shares held in frl by the biyanis in any manner without prior written consent of amazon.
the future group and amazon have been locked in a battle after the us based company took frl into the emergency arbitration over alleged breach of a contract between them.
the three domestic firms — frl  fcpl and reliance — have however contended before the high court that if amazon’s claim — that it indirectly invested in frl by investing in fcl — was accepted then it would amount to a violation of indian foreign direct investment laws which permit only 10 per cent investment by a foreign entity in the multi brand retail sector.
according to amazon  the ea award passed under the singapore international arbitration centre  siac  rules is enforceable under section 17 2  of the arbitration and conciliation act.
it referred to an order passed by the high court on december 21  2020  prima facie holding that the ea’s award was valid under the indian law.
senior advocate harish salve  also representing frl  had earlier submitted that amazon had a deal with fcpl and signed an agreement with biyani.
fcpl has a shareholding agreement with frl which has no agreement with amazon.
subramanium had urged that frl shall not further precipitate the situation as the matter is being heard by the court.
in the petition  amazon has alleged that future group  kishore biyani and other promoters and directors have deliberately and maliciously disobeyed the ea award despite it being binding on them and not having challenged it in accordance with the law.
the majority respondents’ action of simply ignoring the order  of ea  and continuing with the impugned transaction  deal  is not only contumacious but calls into serious question their respect for enforceability of contracts  the rule of law and the administration of justice.
.
it said.
it sought to injunct future group and its officials from taking any steps in furtherance of the deal with reliance.
in august last year  future had reached an agreement to sell its retail  wholesale  logistics and warehousing units to reliance.
the siac on october 25 last year  had passed an interim order in favour of amazon barring frl from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.
subsequently  amazon wrote to market regulator sebi  stock exchanges and competition commission of india  cci   urging them to take into consideration the singapore arbitrator’s interim decision as it is a binding order  frl had earlier told the high court.
as per the siac interim order  a three member arbitration panel needs to be set up within 90 days  from the date of the judgement  with one judge each being appointed by future and amazon  along with a third neutral judge.
on november 10  2020  amazon had told the court that it and fcl have appointed their respective arbitrators.

30 प्रतिशत की बड़ी कटौती की घोषणा की है। यही नहीं  एसबीआई ने प्रोसेसिंग फीस पर 100 प्रतिशत की छूट देने की घोषणा की है। बैंक द्वारा जारी एक प्रेस विज्ञप्ति में  यह स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि यह ग्राहकों की सुविधा के लिए समय समय पर ऐसे महत्वपूर्ण कदम उठाता रहेगा। ज्ञात हो कि यह बैंक समय समय पर होम लोन पर कई तरह के ऑफर देता रहा है। बैंक की प्रेस विज्ञप्ति में कहा गया है कि उसने अब अपने पहले से चल रहे प्रस्तावों को ऋण राशि और cibil स्कोर के आधार पर होम लोन पर बेहतर और अधिक छूट देकर अधिक लाभदायक और आकर्षक बना दिया है। एसबीआई के अनुसार  इस निर्णय का मुख्य उद्देश्य उन ग्राहकों को बेहतर ब्याज दरों की पेशकश करना है  जिनके पास ऋण भुगतान का अच्छा रिकॉर्ड है। वर्तमान में  sbi के होम लोन की ब्याज दरें cibil स्कोर से जुड़ी हुई हैं और 30 लाख रुपये तक के ऋण के लिए  दर 6.
80 प्रतिशत है और 30 लाख से ऊपर के ऋण के लिए  ब्याज दर 6.
95 प्रतिशत है। पांच करोड़ तक के कर्ज पर ब्याज में 0.
30 प्रतिशत की रियायत देश के आठ शहरों में उपलब्ध है। बैंक ने कहा है कि ग्राहक योनो ऐप या https //homeloans.

05 प्रतिशत की अतिरिक्त छूट मिलेगी। बैंक के yono ऐप के जरिए आवेदन करने वालों को 0.
5 प्रतिशत की अलग छूट दी जाएगी। नई दरें इस साल मार्च के अंत तक लागू हैं।    होम लोन पर नई ब्याज दरें ग्राहक के cibil स्कोर से जुड़ी होंगी। इसका मतलब है कि जिस ग्राहक का cibil स्कोर बेहतर होगा उसे कम ब्याज देना होगा। कटौती के बाद  30 लाख रुपये तक के ऋण के लिए ब्याज दर 6.
80 प्रतिशत से शुरू होगी और 6.
95 प्रतिशत से ऊपर के ऋण के लिए होगी।  घर खरीदारों को आकर्षक रियायतें देने के उद्देश्य से  इसने होम लोन पर 30 बेसिस प्वाइंट की कटौती  प्रोसेसिंग फीस पर 100 प्रतिशत की छूट और महिला ग्राहकों के लिए ब्याज दरों में पांच प्रतिशत की छूट देने का फैसला किया है।    दिल्ली समेत आठ महानगरों में पांच करोड़ रुपये तक के कर्ज पर ब्याज दरों में भी 0.
30 प्रतिशत तक की कटौती की गई है।  जानिये क्या होता है सिबिल स्कोर  क्रेडिट इंफॉर्मेशन ब्यूरो इंडिया लिमिटेड  cibil  एक ऐसी संस्था है  जो इस बात पर नज़र रखती है कि किसी व्यक्ति ने अतीत में अब तक कितना ऋण लिया है  उसकी आय हर महीने या हर साल कितनी अर्जित की जाती है। यह भी देखा जाता है कि आदमी समय पर कर्ज चुकाता है या नहीं। उसके पास क्रेडिट कार्ड है या नहीं। अगर वह समय पर अपना बकाया चुकाता है या नहीं। क्या वह इसमें देरी भी करता है  इसके आधार पर वह 300 और 900 के बीच के व्यक्ति को चिन्हित करती है। cibil पैमाने पर  900 को सबसे अच्छा स्कोर माना जाता है और 300 को सबसे खराब माना जाता है। इसका मतलब यह है कि 800 cibil स्कोर वाले लोग 500 स्कोर वाले लोगों की तुलना में आसानी से ऋण प्राप्त कर सकते हैं। यह एक महत्वपूर्ण मानदंड है।  नए साल का तोहफा  नई पेशकश से घर खरीदार आकर्षित होंगे  घर खरीदारों के लिए नए साल का उपहार क्या हो सकता है  भारतीय स्टेट बैंक  एसबीआई  ने शुक्रवार को आठ शहरों में होम लोन पर 30 जीबी तक की ब्याज दर रियायत और प्रसंस्करण शुल्क पर 100  छूट की घोषणा की। बैंक ने यह भी घोषणा की है कि वह शेष स्थानान्तरण पर 5 बीपीएस रियायतें देगा  यह जोड़कर कि महिला उधारकर्ताओं को अतिरिक्त 5 बीपीएस रियायत मिलेगी। देश के सबसे बड़े होम लोन प्रदाता एसबीआई ने एक बयान में कहा कि उसे उम्मीद है कि उसकी नई पेशकश से घर खरीदार आकर्षित होंगे और ग्राहकों को बेहतर दरों की पेशकश करेंगे। विशेष रूप से एसबीआई ब्याज ऋण क्रेडिट इन्फ़र्मेशन ब्यूरो  इंडिया  लिमिटेड  cibil  स्कोर से जुड़े होते हैं। वे 30 लाख रुपये तक के ऋण के लिए 6.
80 प्रतिशत से शुरू होते हैं और 30 लाख रुपये से ऊपर के ऋण के लिए 6.
95 प्रतिशत। एसबीआई एमडी ने कहा   हम मार्च से 21 मार्च तक होम लोन ग्राहकों के लिए अपनी रियायतों में सुधार करना चाहते हैं। होम लोन पर एसबीआई के सबसे कम ब्याज के साथ  हमें विश्वास है कि इस कदम से होम बायर्स को घर बनाने का निर्णय लेने में सक्षम बनाया जाएगा। देश में महामारियों के बाद घर खरीदारों और रियल एस्टेट क्षेत्र को आगे बढ़ने के लिए एसबीआई का समर्थन जारी रहेगा।  नए साल 2021 में ऋण से छुटकारा पाने के लिए इन तरीकों का प्रयास करें  यदि आपके पास कई ऋण हैं  क्रेडिट कार्ड बिल लंबित हैं  तो ऋण मुक्त होने में समय  प्रयास और योजना लगेगा। यदि आप अपने ऋण से छुटकारा पा लेते हैं  तो आप अपने आप को अधिक आर्थिक रूप से सुरक्षित और मानसिक रूप से संतुलित पाएंगे। इस नए वर्ष 2021 में ऋण मुक्त रहने के लिए  इन 5 चीजों को करना आवश्यक है। देखो और अमल करो।  1.
निश्चित खर्चों को देखते हुए एक दूसरी सूची तैयार करें क्योंकि कुछ खर्च ऐसे होते हैं जिन्हें अनिवार्य रूप से किया जाना आवश्यक होता है। जैसे कि किराया  ईएमआई  भोजन खर्च  वाहन आदि। पहला कदम कर्ज का प्रबंधन करते समय अपनी आय और खर्चों की एक सूची तैयार करना है।  2.
अर्जित की गई सभी चीज़ों को लिखें और 30 दिनों के दौरान खर्च करें। ऋण को साफ करने के लिए आपको अपने खर्चों में कटौती करने की आवश्यकता है। अपनी मासिक सदस्यता की समीक्षा करें  क्योंकि जिम सदस्यता  केबल टीवी और ऑनलाइन स्ट्रीमिंग सदस्यता जैसी सेवाएं जल्दी से आपको कर्ज के जाल में डाल सकती हैं।  3.
आपको तय तिथि तक अपने क्रेडिट कार्ड पर बकाया राशि का भुगतान करने का प्रयास करना चाहिए। आपको ऋण राहत को सर्वोच्च प्राथमिकता देने की आवश्यकता है  और आप ऐसा कर सकते हैं कि कोई भी पुनर्भुगतान छूट न जाए। ऑटो डेबिट विकल्प का विकल्प चुनें ताकि आपके लोन की ईएमआई  क्रेडिट कार्ड बिल का भुगतान हर महीने समय पर हो।  4.
कर्ज से बाहर निकलने के लिए आप पुनर्भुगतान रणनीतियों में से किसी एक को अपना सकते हैं। आप  न्यूनतम से अधिक भुगतान  कर सकते हैं। यदि आपके पास बचत का अधिशेष है  तो आप अपने कर्ज को कम करने के लिए हर महीने न्यूनतम राशि से अधिक का भुगतान कर सकते हैं।  भारतीय रिजर्व बैंक की लोन मोरेटोरियम ने कर्जदारों को राहत दी लेकिन.

वित्त पोषण गतिविधि को पुनर्वित्त और 2020 में उधार देने पर जोर दिया गया था। शिल्पा मनकर अहलूवालिया  पार्टनर  शार्दुल अमरचंद मंगलदास एंड कंपनी का कहना है कि  आरबीआई की लोन मोरेटोरियम ने covid  19 से प्रभावित कर्जदारों को बहुत आवश्यक राहत प्रदान की  लेकिन यह अस्थायी अल्पकालिक समाधान था।प्रियदर्शनी माजी के साथ एक विशेष साक्षात्कार में  वह कहती हैं कि नियामकों को संभवतः वित्तीय क्षेत्र में तनाव को प्रबंधित करने के लिए अतिरिक्त रणनीतियों के बारे में सोचना होगा  जबकि तरलता सुनिश्चित करना भी होगा क्योंकि covid 19 का आर्थिक प्रभाव 2021 में जारी है। rbi स्थगन योजना ने covid 19 से प्रभावित कर्जदारों को बहुत आवश्यक राहत प्रदान की  लेकिन अनिवार्य रूप से एक अस्थायी अल्पकालिक समाधान था।  लोन मोरेटोरियम वित्तीय प्रोत्साहन   rbi द्वारा प्रभाव और उपाय  आरबीआई ने 27 मार्च को एक स्थगन योजना जारी की थी  जिससे बैंकों और ऋण देने वाली संस्थाओं को 1 मार्च से 31 मई  2020 की अवधि के दौरान ब्याज  मूलधन और ईएमआई के भुगतान पर रोक लगाने की अनुमति दी गई थी। बाद में यह अवधि 31 अगस्त  2020 तक बढ़ा दी गई। । rbi ने बाद में  अगस्त 2020 में  एक बार की पुनर्गठन योजना की शुरुआत की  जिससे बैंकों और ऋण संस्थानों को covid 19 संबंधित तनाव का सामना करने वाले ऋण खातों की कुछ श्रेणियों का पुनर्गठन करने की अनुमति मिली  जो एक बहुत जरूरी पहल थी। कई उधारदाताओं द्वारा दी जाने वाली कर्जदार अपेक्षा और स्थगन योजनाओं के बीच एक बेमेल संबंध था। जबकि उधारकर्ताओं को राहत देना महत्वपूर्ण है  बैंकिंग क्षेत्र के सामने आने वाले तनाव को पहचानना भी महत्वपूर्ण है  और एक ढांचा जो पूरी तरह से उधार देने वाली संस्थाओं को covid  19 की वित्तीय लागत आवंटित करता है या एनपीए के रूप में तनावग्रस्त खातों के वर्गीकरण में देरी करता है। लंबे समय में व्यवहार्य नहीं है।  बैंकिंग और वित्त क्षेत्र के बाद covid 19  बैंकिंग और वित्त क्षेत्र ने तनाव के बाद covid 19 का अपना हिस्सा देखा। गैर बैंकिंग वित्तीय संस्थानों  विशेष रूप से  एक तरलता की कमी का सामना करना पड़ा  जो कि आरबीआई की अधिस्थगन योजना द्वारा आंशिक रूप से शुरू हो गया  जिसने एनबीएफसी को अधिस्थगन का लाभ नहीं बढ़ाया  उधारकर्ता समूह के रूप में   जबकि उनमें से कई ने योजनाओं के लिए रोल आउट किया। यह देखते हुए कि covid 19 का प्रतिकूल आर्थिक प्रभाव जारी रहने की संभावना है  बैंकिंग क्षेत्र को तनावग्रस्त परिसंपत्तियों का प्रबंधन करने के तरीके पर फिर से विचार करना होगा। जबकि आरबीआई अधिस्थगन ढांचा उधारकर्ताओं को अल्पकालिक राहत प्रदान करने में प्रभावी था  कुछ मायनों में इसने समस्या को भविष्य की तारीख के साथ जोड़ दिया।  posted by  navodit saktawat  नईदुनिया ई पेपर पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करे  नईदुनिया ई पेपर पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करे  डाउनलोड करें नईदुनिया ऐप   पाएं मध्यप्रदेश  छत्तीसगढ़ और देश दुनिया की सभी खबरों के साथ नईदुनिया ई पेपर राशिफल और कई फायदेमंद सर्विसेस  डाउनलोड करें नईदुनिया ऐप   पाएं मध्यप्रदेश  छत्तीसगढ़ और देश दुनिया की सभी खबरों के साथ नईदुनिया ई पेपर राशिफल और कई फायदेमंद सर्विसेस",emi  personal loan  home loan for those who take big cuts in interest rates  100 percent discount on processing fees

"up board exams 2021  उत्तर प्रदेश माध्यमिक शिक्षा परिषद ने इस साल की यूपी बोर्ड परीक्षा 2021 के लिए केंद्रों के लिए नियम सख्त कर दिए हैं.
अब कई पैमानों पर खरे उतरने वाले स्कूल ही एग्जाम सेंटर बनाए जाएंगे.
ऐसा इसलिए हो रहा है ताकि स्कूलों में नकल न होने पाए और साफ सुथरे तरीके से परीक्षा का आयोजन किया जा सके.
यूपीएमपीएसपी द्वारा जारी विभिन्न गाइडलाइंस फॉलो करने वाले स्कूल ही इस बार परीक्षा केंद्र में तब्दील किए जाएंगे.
कोरोना के कारण मेंटेन होगी सोशल डिस्टेंसिंग    इस साल कोरोना के कारण स्कूल सोशल डिस्टेंसिंग का पालन करेंगे.
इस वजह से परीक्षा केंद्रों की संख्या पिछले सालों की तुलना में बढ़ाई जाएगी.
इस बार यूपी बोर्ड परीक्षा 2021 के लिए परीक्षा केंद्र पिछली बार से डेढ़ गुना ज्यादा संख्या में होंगे.
इससे स्टूडेंट्स दूर दूर बैठकर परीक्षा दे पाएंगे.
स्कूल तक जाती हो दस फीट रोड    परीक्षा केंद्र बनाने की बहुत सी शर्तों में से एक मुख्य शर्त है कि वही स्कूल एग्जाम सेंटर बनाया जाएगा जिसके सामने से दस फीट चौड़ी रोड जाती हो.
ऐसा इसलिए ताकि वहां कार आसानी से चली जाए.
दरअसल परीक्षा के दौरान फ्लाइंग स्कॉयड कारों से ही आता है.
ऐसे में सड़क ठीक न होने पर या गली आदि से गुजरने में बहुत समय चला जाता है और जिस तेजी से उन्हें स्कूल पहुंचना चाहिए वे नहीं पहुंच पाते.
इसी कारण से यह नियम इस बार लागू किया गया है.
इन स्कूलों पर नहीं लागू होगा नियम    दस फीट चौड़ी सड़क का नियम सहायता प्राप्त स्कूलों और प्राइवेट स्कूलों पर लागू नहीं होगा.
दरअसल इनके पास इतनी सुविधा ही नहीं होती कि वे इस मानक पर खरे उतर पाएं.
आपकी जानकारी के लिए बता दें एग्जाम सेंटर एलॉटमेंट पॉलिसी 25 नवंबर को यूपी सरकार की ओर से जारी की गई थी.
जिन स्कूलों को सेंटर बनाया जाएगा पहले उनका फिजिकल वैरीफिकेशन होगा और यह काम शुरू भी हो चुका है.
ऐसा इसलिए भी की 20 दिसंबर से पहले स्कूलों की जांच का काम पूरा होना है.
बिजली की व्यवस्था भी हो दुरुस्त    बाकी नियमों के अलावा परीक्षा केंद्र बनाने के लिए जरूरी है कि उस स्कूल में बिजली की प्रॉपर व्यवस्था हो.
यानी पूरे समय इलेक्ट्रिसिटी उपलब्ध रहती हो.
इसके साथ ही वे स्कूल जिनके ऊपर से हाईटेंशन की लाइन गुजरती है उन्हें भी सेंटर नहीं बनाया जा सकता.
कुल मिलाकर बोर्ड किसी प्रकार का खतरा मोल लेने की नहीं सोच रहा.
सभी पैमानों पर खरे उतरने वाले स्कूल ही परीक्षा केंद्र बनेंगे.

publisher  abp live hindi",latest news   n up board exams 2021  the board rules made for the examination centers  now compulsory to meet these conditions
"the union budget presentation is usually accompanied by a flurry of excitement in the media with experts waxing eloquent on various proposals.
but the numbers and the jargon can be quite bewildering to someone who is tuning in for the first time.
if you are one such person  here are answers to some of your questions   what’s the union budget all about   the union budget is quite similar to your household budget.
when you prepare your annual budget  you list the income from various sources followed by the list of your expenses.
that lets you gauge if you will have surplus income or if there will be a shortfall  which will have to be bridged by borrowing.
the union budget similarly estimates the income and expenditure of the centre for the next financial year  april 2021 to march 2022.
the difference between the two is the surplus or deficit.
the states similarly prepare annual statements that capture their income  that includes tax revenue shared by the centre  and expenses.
why are receipts and expenses in the budget being classified as revenue and capital   the budget attempts to distinguish between ongoing expenses for running the government and the income needed to sustain these from the expenses for creation of long term assets.
hence the differentiation.
revenue receipts include tax and non tax revenues of the centre.
non tax receipts consist of interest and dividend on centre’s investments and other receipts for services rendered by the centre.
revenue expenditure includes expenses incurred in the normal running of government departments and for rendering of various services  making interest payments on debt  subsidies  grants in aid  etc.
all grants given to the state governments/uts and others are also treated as revenue expenditure.
capital receipts are market loans raised by the centre from the public  the rbi  from foreign governments and bodies  disinvestment receipts and recoveries of loans from state and uts.
capital expenditure consists of expenditure on acquisition of assets like land  buildings  machinery  equipment  as also investments in shares and loans and advances granted by the centre to the state and uts  psus and others.
there are so many deficit numbers  which one should i focus on   the budget mentions four types of deficits.
the fiscal deficit  revenue deficit  effective revenue deficit and primary deficit.
the most important of the four is the fiscal deficit that is the difference between total receipts  excluding borrowing  and total expenditure.
this number captures the essence of the centre’s finances  the extent to which the required expenses are being met by the available income.
the fiscal deficit also denotes the extent to which the centre will have to borrow in the fiscal year to meet the revenue shortfall.
the focus of the centre over the last few years has been to be fiscally prudent.
the frbm  fiscal responsibility and budget management  act  2003  had therefore set limits for the fiscal deficit for the centre.
these have  of course  gone for a toss due to the pandemic and a new time line is now being issued.
the revenue deficit is the difference between revenue receipts and revenue expenditure and shows if the government is being run within the means available.
effective revenue deficit is calculated by excluding the grants given by the centre to states and union territories for creation of capital assets.
the primary deficit is obtained by deducting the interest payments on previous borrowings from the fiscal deficit.
what are the sections relevant to me   if you are a salaried person  you will have to look at the proposed changes in income tax – increase in standard deduction  tweaking of tax slabs  increase in surcharge etc.
tax breaks can be announced on investments or changes made in taxability of profits or gains from various investments – stocks  debt  insurance  nps.
watch out for these.
besides these  tweaks in customs duties on imports can increase or decrease your payouts for purchases.
if you run a business  the changes in corporation tax  any new tax breaks relevant to the sector you operate in  will be relevant to you.
usually the budget speech does not contain the finer details on tax proposals and you will have to scan the finance bill and the memorandum to get all the details.
however note that these are just proposals and the contour of the tax may change when finally passed by parliament  many times a proposal gets silently buried too.
what are the budget documents that i need to see   the fm’s speech will give you a good idea of the key proposals and numbers.
if you are interested in a quick over view of the numbers  take a look at the ‘budget at a glance’ statement.
the new document introduced last year  ‘budget highlights’  will also be useful if you do not want to get in to the nitty gritty.

"extraordinary times require extraordinary policy responses.
against the backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty in the time of the covid 19 pandemic  finance minister nirmala sitharaman has presented a  significant  fiscal deficit number – which went upto 9.
5  in fy21 – from a position of strength.
simultaneously  commencing a fiscal consolidation path to execute an  excessive deficit procedure  in the union budget 2012 22 to bring down the excess deficit of 9.
5  of gdp in fy21 to 4.
5  by fy26 is inevitable.
however  this narrative of  deficit is good  in the time of a pandemic is welcome.
the fiscal consolidation through expenditure compression rather than increased tax buoyancy affects the quality of fiscal consolidation.
from that perspective  allowing the fiscal deficit to rise above the threshold level of 3  of gdp  without significant expenditure compression  is welcome.
however  the anatomy of the determinants of borrowings – decomposed by revenue uncertainties  economic stimulus related spending  the narrowing of denominator gdp  lowering of rates of interest  etc.
– would be interesting to understand with precision which components have exactly contributed to the aggregate level of high deficits.
the cleaning up of deficit incurred from off budget liabilities through public sector undertakings is still a matter of concern.
such borrowings do not figure in the concept of fiscal deficit.
however  the union budget 2021 22 has not introduced the deficit termed as  public sector borrowing requirement  psbr    integrating the borrowings incurred through public sector enterprises.
the details of extra borrowings are kept in an annexure in the union budget document.
the new fiscal rules  the new fiscal responsibility and budget management  amendment  is tabled in the parliament today.
the existing fiscal rules have been amended to incorporate the revised threshold of deficit to gdp.
this is the third time the frbm has been amended in india.
as per the second amendment  the  revenue balance  was eliminated and clauses about  revenue balance  were incorporated in the financial bill to move away from the  golden  fiscal  rule  of zero revenue deficits.
also read  snapshot  budget 2021 and key sector allocation in seven charts  though there was a debate regarding the choice of deficit – whether revenue deficit  fiscal deficit or primary deficit was to be the  operational deficit parameter  in india – in the frbm committee report with a dissent note from arvind subramanian favouring the primary deficit  fiscal deficit minus interest payments   the union budget 2021 22 reiterated that fiscal deficit is still the operational concept of deficit in india.
however  primary deficit is useful to understand the current fiscal stance without the legacy of past interest payments  table 1.

in the regime of revenue uncertainties  the ambitious asset monetisation programme announced in the union budget to generate revenue proceeds need a supporting regulatory framework.
in the union budget 2021 22.
the economic stimulus is announced not as a macroeconomic stimulus to revive the demand by providing huge cash transfers or a universal basic income  ubi.
the concern was that if the people’s propensity to save is greater than spending in the time of a pandemic  dropping  helicopter money  or a ubi in the hands of the people cannot lead to required demand stimulation.
the statistics shows that precautionary savings by the private sector are on the rise during covid 19.
instead of massive cash transfers  the union budget has provided targeted economic stimulus  especially to capital infrastructure and the public health sector.
the total size of the budget for fy21 has increased to rs 34.
50 lakh crore.
in fy22  total expenditure is pegged at rs 35 lakh crore.
the emphasis on capital infrastructure spending for economic revival by increasing the capital expenditure for fy2021 22 by 34.
5  to rs 5.
5 lakh crore is welcome.
the estimates of capital expenditure for fy21 have been increased to rs 4.
39 lakh crore  as against the budgeted rs 4.
12 lakh crore.
however  as percentage of gdp  the capital expenditure as share of gdp is still below 2.
the financing details of the other capital infrastructure projects announced in the budget through ppp models need further clarity.
the decision on intergovernmental fiscal transfers  the finance minister has announced a new centrally sponsored scheme  css  for enhancing public health infrastructure – the pm atmanirbhar swasth bharat yojana – with an outlay of rs 64 180 crore over the next six years.
this css will be in addition to the government’s existing national health mission.
the focus of a new css in the health sector will be on three areas – preventive  curative and well being.
also read  union budget 2021  election bound states get multi crore infra allocations  however  the finance minister has also announced a plausible convergence of css  as recommended by the fifteenth finance commission report  which is tabled in the parliament today.
this move will shift the composition of intergovernmental fiscal transfers from conditional grants to tax transfer formula based unconditional transfers  which is 41  of tax pool as recommended by the fifteenth finance commission.
the unconditional transfers provide flexibility to state governments to prioritise their spending  rather than designing  top down  programmes.
however  designing a new public health infrastructure related css can affect the fiscal autonomy of the states in dealing with the issues of the health sector  unless it is judiciously rolled out within the contours of cooperative federalism.
union budget ‘nudging’ the calculus of consent  finally  the emphasis on state level public infrastructure investment in the union budget  including the states like kerala and west bengal  invokes the calculus of voting behaviour.
does democracy determine public expenditure decisions  the union budget 2021 22 can answer this in the affirmative only in the forthcoming subnational elections.
economists globally have analysed empirically whether positive public policy decisions by the dominant party in power or the economics of ethno fragmentation and religion matter more for a median voter to choose their government.
if it is the former  that the calculus of consent favours the party in power  then the union budget 2021 22 could effectively signal the benefits.

a new study indicates that diabetes during pregnancy may increase the risk of heart disease.
the study suggests that women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy  gestational diabetes  are twice as likely by mid life to develop calcium in heart arteries    a strong predictor of heart disease    even if healthy blood sugar levels were attained many years after pregnancy.
we were surprised to discover that women with a history of gestational diabetes are at a significantly greater risk of heart artery calcification  even if they maintain normal blood sugar levels after pregnancy   said co author erica p.
gunderson from kaiser permanente in california  us.
for the study  published in circulation  journal of the american heart association  the team enrolled approximately 1 100 women without type 1 or type 2 diabetes who subsequently gave birth at least once during the 25 year study period  which ended in 2011.
blood tests were performed from before to after pregnancies at five year intervals to determine if women had normal blood sugar levels  intermediate elevations in blood sugar levels  pre diabetes  or they had developed overt type 2 diabetes.
heart scans were performed to measure coronary artery calcium  a strong predictor for heart disease  at exams 15  20 and 25 years after the baseline  the first exam of the study.
at the 25 year follow up  the participants  median age was 48 years  and 12 per cent of the women in the study had a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes.
the prospective analysis found that women with a history of gestational diabetes had a two fold higher risk of coronary artery calcification whether they had healthy blood sugar levels  pre diabetes or type 2 diabetes.
of women with previous gestational diabetes  36 per cent developed pre diabetes and 26 per cent developed type 2 diabetes  compared to 35 per cent and 9 per cent of women with no history of gestational diabetes  the researchers said.

6gbps download and upload speeds respectively  mediatek helio m80 is expected to feature on a smartphone by late 2021 or early 2022  mediatek has unveiled a new 5g modem called the helio m80.
unlike its previous generation offerings found on dimensity branded chipsets  this particular modem is compatible with faster  but less reliable mmwave 5g networks.
some key mediatek helio m80 features include eight component carriers  8cc   sub 6 ghz and mmwave dual connectivity and carrier aggregation  and dynamic spectrum sharing  dss.
the mediatek helio m80 also supports dual 5g sim  dual 5g nsa and sa networks  and dual voice over new radio  vonr  for more reliable connectivity.
however  it will be some time before we get to see the modem in action.
mediatek says that the helio m80 will be launched ‘later this year’ and is expected to make its debut alongside a smartphone sometime in 2022.

it has plans to enter the acpc  always connected pc  space too  with its upcoming mediatek t700 modem.
there are several 5g hotspots in the works too  powered by its mediatek 750 modem.
connecting to a 5g network over mmwave is fairly battery intensive.
that is where the mediatek helio m80’s ultrasave network environment detection and ultrasave ota content awareness technologies come in.
they allow connected chipsets to dynamically adjust power configuration and operating frequency based on the network environment.
the helio m80 also integrates mediatek’s dynamic bandwidth part  bwp  technology that dynamically allocates bandwidth based on the workload.
until now  access to mmwave 5g networks have been restricted to a handful of high end flagship smartphones that run top of the line samsung and qualcomm chipsets.
the mediatek helio m80 will allow relatively affordable smartphones to connect to mmwave networks  something that is essential for the spread of 5g networks in the future.

based on a presentation at the arrs 2019 annual meeting  honolulu  hi  patients with biopsy proven nafld who underwent ct within 1 year of biopsy were included.

the presence of any lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning was categorized as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  nash   while patients with nafld and advanced fibrosis  stage f3 or higher  were categorized as having high risk nafld.

"by aditi khanna  london  feb 1  pti  the commonwealth journalists association  cja  on monday urged the indian government to honour its international commitments to the commonwealth and the united nations and ensure that the media is free to play its constitutional role as a guardian of the public interest and in holding elected governments to account.
the cja  a 43 year old organisation advocating press freedom  called on the relevant authorities to withdraw the first information reports  firs  issued against leading editors and journalists for their coverage of the farmers’ protest in delhi on january 26.
the cja is particularly alarmed at the use of laws pertaining to sedition and criminal conspiracy against journalists who were simply doing their job  reporting events as they happened.
many of these laws are of colonial origin and in urgent need of reform   reads the cja statement.
the cja urges the government to act firmly to protect those journalists who face harassment online and offline  death threats  violence and even assassination in the course of their work and to end the impunity enjoyed by their attackers.
india’s reputation as the world’s largest democracy is increasingly at risk as cases of arbitrary arrests and prosecutions multiply   it adds.
the statement is the latest from journalists  groups after farmers  protests in delhi turned violent on the republic day when protesters broke into the red fort complex resulting in one death and hundreds of injuries.
journalists are among those arrested or facing charges in relation to the protests against the government s proposed agricultural reforms.
congress mp shashi tharoor and the six journalists    mrinal pande  rajdeep sardesai  vinod jose  zafar agha  paresh nath and anant nath    have been booked by police  including in bjp ruled states such as uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh  over their allegedly misleading tweets on the violence during the farmers  tractor rally in delhi on republic day.
freelance journalist mandeep punia and dharmender singh  with online news india  were detained by delhi police sunday evening for allegedly misbehaving with personnel on duty.
while singh was later released  the police arrested punia on sunday.

"london  feb 1  pti  the gandhian spirit of protecting the society s most vulnerable is being invoked by health officials as the uk achieved its target of administering life saving jabs to a majority of care home residents and staff as part of its covid 19 phased vaccination programme on monday.
ian turner  executive chair of the registered nursing home association – the country s national association representing the interests of care homes  expressed his gratitude to the state funded national health service  nhs  as well as all the scientists and researchers who made it possible for the section of british society most at risk of dying from covid 19 now having some protection against the disease.
as mahatma gandhi said  ‘the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable   and the pandemic has brought that quotation to the fore   said turner  referring to the phased role out of the vaccination programme.
on behalf of all the residents of older people s care homes  their families and those who have continued to provide care and support to them during the pandemic  i would like to express their heartfelt gratitude to all those involved in the vaccination programme.
from the scientists and researchers  those who participated and managed the trials  to the regulators and manufacturers of the vaccine through to the whole nhs vaccination teams wherever they may be working  we want to thank them for their extraordinary work over the past months   he said.
the nhs said nurses  general practitioners  gps  and other nhs staff have offered the life saving jab to people living at more than 10 000 care homes with older residents  with only a small remainder visits deferred by local directors of public health for safety reasons during a local outbreak.
the uk s joint committee of vaccinations and immunisations  jcvi  was responsible for setting out the priority groups for the covid vaccines and had stipulated older adult care home residents and their staff as high priority groups due to being at particular risk from covid 19 because of their age and frailty.
nhs england offered gps up to gbp 30 extra to vaccinate care home residents in january to cover the increased time and logistics required in bringing the vaccine to care homes.
it has been a privilege to vaccinate some of the most vulnerable people and the wonderful people who look after them.
many have had little contact with the outside world throughout the pandemic and so it has been truly humbling for all  giving them hope and importantly protection against the disease   said dr gp nikki kanani  nhs england s primary care director  who also urged everyone to come forward for their free jabs when contacted by the nhs.
now  with a majority covered with at least one of the two dose oxford/astrazeneca vaccines  the focus will be on expanding the spread of the first doses as well as administering the second booster doses within a few weeks  time.
the uk government has set a target to vaccinate care home residents and carers  people over 70 and frontline care workers by february 15.
meanwhile  a further 587 virus related deaths were reported on sunday  which takes the uk s covid 19 death toll to 106 158 as the country remains under a strict  stay at home  lockdown to keep control over a very high infection rate.

finance minister nirmala sitharaman said in the budget speech of 2021 22 on monday that the government holds the housing and affordable houses in priority areas.

"union finance minister nirmala sitharaman.
new delhi  against the backdrop of a coronavirus battered economy and huge revenue crunch  union finance minister nirmala sitharaman unveiled a ‘never before’ like budget  going by her promise to provide the much needed firepower to turn the nascent economic recovery into a robust engine of growth.
for fm sitharaman  presenting the third budget was much more challenging because of the unprecedented economic contraction than her previous two exercises in july 2019 and february 2020.
the budget stepped up investment in social and physical infrastructure to bolster growth.
its underlying philosophy was in tune with the economic survey.
more importantly  fm sitharaman’s third budget deserves praise for what it didn’t do— succumbing to the temptation of any populist measure to secure public approval by levying additional taxes  read covid cess  on the rich.
the finance minister projected the government’s capital expenditure—the spending to create new assets—to rise 34.
5 per cent to rs 5.
54 lakh crore in the fiscal year 2021 22  in a clear intent to focus on demand generation and job creation in the country.
furthermore  the government said that it will provide an additional rs 2 lakh crore to states for capex over and above its own commitment.
in the current scenario  an increase in infrastructure spending by the centre holds the potential to propel the indian economy on a high growth trajectory.
in a welcome move  the government has focused on the financing of infrastructure by setting up a rs 20 000 crore development finance institution  dfi  to fund infrastructure projects in segments such as housing and construction that will have high multiplier effects and a major job creator.
fm sitharaman dwelt on six major points of action  and one of them is health and wellbeing.
the coronavirus crisis prompted the centre to bolster healthcare spending by 137 per cent this year  increasing the overall outlay to health and wellbeing to nearly rs 2.
25 lakh crore.
plus  the pm aatmanirbhar swastha bharat scheme with an outlay of rs 64 180 crore scheme is significant as it would help in fighting the covid 19 by making the vaccine available to all.
to further strengthen the fight against the coronavirus pandemic  the government has allocated rs 35 000 crore for covid 19 vaccine  with additional funds to be released if required.
fm sitharamam budgeted rs 1.
75 lakh crore from stake sale in public sector companies and financial institutions  including two state run banks and insurance behemoth life insurance corporation of india  lic  in the next fiscal year.
it is not an exaggeration to say that one of the key takeaways of the budget 2021 22 is the sale of surplus land lying with government ministries and public sector enterprises in a bid to raise money to fund infrastructure projects.
a growth oriented budget that brings in more stability in the policy sphere.
the budget has rightly focused on physical and financial infrastructure.
this time around we are little more optimistic on disinvestment targets.
another aspect is that of improving transparency in fiscal math  although it needs some more improvements   says n.
r.
bhanumurthy  vice chancellor of the bangalore based dr b.
r.
ambedkar school of economics university.
in these unprecedented times  the finance ministry refrained from consolidating the fiscal deficit significantly and focused on supporting growth.
the fiscal deficit next year is likely to be at 6.
8 per cent of gross domestic product  gdp.
the deficit will be 9.
5 per cent for the current year  against a planned 3.
5 per cent.
the government will borrow about rs 12 lakh crore to meet the shortfall  less than the record rs 12.
80 lakh crore in the current financial year.
many economists are of the view that the government could afford to spend more as it has been spending less than most asian economies on stimulus packages.
when the nation has started seeing some light after the long and dark tunnel of the pandemic  the budget has rightly shed some of the earlier fiscal conservatism and have chosen not to be a hostage of the rating agencies.
by increasing capital expenditure and social sector expenditure  and proposing a dfi for infrastructure financing  expectedly it is going to give a fillip to growth   explains partha ray  a professor of economics at indian institute of management  iim  calcutta.
there continues to be a good case for an expansionary fiscal policy  and if some risk has to be taken  this is not a bad time to do so.
so  what is the antidote to india s economic woes  government spending and deep structural reforms.
the need for urgency is  however  found in the budget 2021 22.

the nightmare ends as bodra wakes up to see the thatched roof over his head and heaves a sigh of relief.
before the lockdown  he worked as a bar bender at a construction site in tumkur.
he had been working there since he was 14.
in eight years  his daily income increased from rs 164 to rs 325.
his job provided brick tiles on their roof  a second hand motorbike and enough food for the family of five.
while many of his friends and neighbours returned to the big cities for work as restrictions were relaxed  bodra is now scared to stay away from his family.
he has been looking for opportunities in his village.
he tried cultivating cauliflower in a part of their seven acre plot  but has run into losses.
he now wants to start a cloth business  but fears that he won’t get a loan from the government which  he says  is busy waiving farmers’ loans.
pointing to the bicycle on which he made the 1 800 km journey home  bodra says   i panicked  when the lockdown was announced.
my mother took a loan of rs 15 000 and deposited it in my account.
i bought a cycle  packed water bottles  rice and bananas.
and set out with others from neighbouring areas.
we rode like there was no tomorrow.
strangers helped us  we ate what was offered and slept on the roadside.
my legs gave up  but my spirit did not.
for me that bicycle is a symbol of a sort of achievement   he says.
more than 5 lakh migrants returned to jharkhand after the lockdown was announced    on bicycles or trucks or foot.
the jharkhand government announced a relief of rs 1 000 and a pack of foodgrains with salt  sugar and oil for those who registered themselves.
it also promised skill mapping of those who had returned so that they can be offered jobs.
but the promises have not translated into action for many like bodra.
the government’s mou with border roads organisation to send labourers for its projects has been a one off success.
a portal on which labourers were to register themselves when they return so that the government may find them suitable work is yet to be rolled out.
the government announced many things  but the administration did not even let us sleep in ranchi and scared us away.
on the 16th day  we reached home.
i didn’t get money or ration.
after a week  i started looking for work  but did not find anything nearby.
many of my friends have returned.
i want to  but cannot.
the whole situation has scared me   bodra says.
he says he has not looked for work under the mgnrega as payments are delayed.
bodra says he sent rs 22 000 for laying brick tiles on their roof a few years ago  but regrets not saving enough for the education of his sisters  studying in class x and class xii.
despite the despair  bodra is confident.
he claims he has done a  market study  for his cloth business plan.
there are a lot of food outlets here  but people have to go far to buy good clothes.
i want to fill the gap  provided i get money to set up the business.
i need a loan.
his interest in clothes is not restricted to a business plan.
he likes dressing up too.
he often sports a borrowed blazer turned inside out    to keep the outside dust free    wears high boots and keeps a french cut beard.
asked if he misses his life in tumkur  bodra says he sometimes misses the sight of an aeroplane.
but i don’t want to leave my state.
i want to stay with my parents   he adds.
the budget connection  the one nation one ration scheme will help migrant workers claim ration from any part in the country.
a new portal to be launched will collect details of workers to formulate health  housing  skills and credit schemes for them.

"union finance minister nirmala sitharaman in her budget speech on february 1 announced an increase in customs duty on various automobile components.
the move was to bring the import tariffs on these components on par with the general duty on the import of auto components.
however  veterans in the automobile industry believe the move is short sighted and is a negative for long term competitiveness.
increasing import duty on auto components to 15 percent not sustainable in the long term   dr pawan goenka told cnbc tv18.
he added   indian component makers have to increase competitiveness by reducing their own costs and not by putting tariff barriers.
also read  budget 2021  key highlights and takeaways from nirmala sitharaman s budget  components on which import duties have been enhanced include toughened and safety glass  parts of electrical lighting or signalling equipment  windscreen wipers  gas compressors  and parts used in suspension and braking systems  as well as those which go into steering and transmission.
customs duties on these parts currently range from 7.
5  10 percent.
source  acma  the top boss at skoda auto volkswagen india agrees.
the increase in customs duty on certain auto parts to 15 percent will further increase input costs and prices for cars which depend on specialised components which cannot be manufactured locally due to unviable volumes   gurparatap boparai  managing director  savwi said.
also read  bottomline  don’t panic at the fiscal deficit number in budget 2021  however  the auto components makers association indicated local players could take advantage of the raised tariffs in the short term.

नयी दिल्ली  15 फरवरी उच्चतम न्यायालय ने सोमवार को टेलीविजन चैनल एनडीटीवी के प्रवर्तकों प्रणय रॉय और राधिका रॉय को राहत दी। न्यायालय ने प्रतिभूति अपीलीय न्यायाधिकरण  सैट  को बाजार नियामक सेबी के आदेश के खिलाफ उनकी अपील पर सुनवाई के लिये जुर्माने की आधी राशि जमा करने की पूर्व शर्त पर जोर नहीं देने का निर्देश दिया है।  एनडीटीवी के प्रवर्तकों ने सैट के उस आदेश को चुनौती दी है जिसमें उन्हें अपील में आने से पहले कथित रूप से गलत तरीके से अर्जित लाभ का एक हिस्सा जमा करने को कहा गया है। भारतीय प्रतिभूति एवं विनिमय बोर्ड  सेबी  ने अपनी जांच में पाया कि एनडीटीवी के इन दोनों प्रवर्तकों ने गलत तरीके से लाभ कमाया है।  मुख्य न्यायाधीश एस ए बोबडे  न्यायाधीश ए एस बोपन्ना और न्यायाधीश वी रामासुब्रमणियम की पीठ ने कहा कि सैट इस मामले में जुर्माना जमा करने पर जोर दिये बिना एनडीटीवी के प्रवर्तकों की अपील पर सुनवाई करे।  पीठ ने कहा  ‘‘अपील पर चार मार्च को सुनवाई होनी है। अपीलों पर सुनवाई के लिये कोई राशि जमा नहीं होने पर जबरन कोई रकम नहीं ली जाएगी।’’ लेकिन पीठ ने यह भी कहा कि ‘‘इस आदेश को मिसाल के रूप में नहीं लिया जाएगा।’’  वीडियो कांफ्रेन्सिंग के जरिये हुई सुनवाई के दौरान सोलिसीटर जनरल तुषार मेहता ने कहा कि सेबी के निर्देश पर रोक लगाने की अनुमति देने के लिए यह पूर्वशर्त रही है कि जर्माना जमा कराया जाए।  प्रवर्तकों की तरफ से पेश मुकुल रोहतगी ने कहा  ‘‘मैं यह नहीं कह रहा कि यह पूर्व शर्त है। वे हमारे घर को कुर्क कर लेंगे।’’  पीठ ने कहा  ‘‘मामले की सुनवाई के लिये अपीलकर्ताओं से जबरन कोई भी राशि नहीं ली जाएगी। यह आदेश कोई मिसाल नहीं होगा।’’  इससे पहले  पीठ ने एनडीटीवी प्रवर्तकों को यह बताने को कहा कि वे मौजूदा बाजार भाव पर कितनी कीमत के शेयर बाजार नियामक सेबी के पास सैट के आदेश के तहत धरोहर के रूप में रखना चाहते है।  प्रवर्तकों ने कहा कि वे हलफनामा देने को इच्छुक हैं कि एनडीटीवी में उनके शेयरोको हस्तांतरित नहीं किया जाएगा।  न्यायालय ने रोहगी के इस बयान को संज्ञान में लिया कि उनके मुवक्किल शेयर और उसके मूल्य के बारे में बयान देने को तैयार हैं।  वकील ने कहा कि एनडीटीवी के प्रत्येक शेयर का मूल्य 37 रुपये है और हमारे पास 50 लाख शेयर हैं। उन्होंने कहा कि वह हलफनामा भरने को तैयार हैं।  सैट ने एनडीटीवी प्रवर्तकों को गलत तरीके से अर्जित लाभ का 50 प्रतिशत सेबी के पास जम करने को कहा था। सेबी ने कुछ ऋण समझौतों के संदर्भ में शेयरधारकों से सूचना छिपाने को लेकर दोनों प्रवर्तकों पर जुर्माना लगाया है।  disclaimer  लोकमत हिन्दी ने इस ख़बर को संपादित नहीं किया है। यह ख़बर पीटीआई भाषा की फीड से प्रकाशित की गयी है।  web title  ndtv promoters should not insist on depositing fines  hear appeals  court directive,ndtv s promoters  promising appeals

"new delhi  fm nirmala sitharaman presented her first paperless union budget and announced a slew of measures on healthcare and infrastructure to give an impetus to the covid hit economy.
union finance minister nirmala sitharaman presented the general union budget of 2021 on monday.
dubbed as the most crucial budget of india in recent years  the budget has come in the backdrop of the largest gross domestic product  gdp  contraction india has suffered post independence due to the covid 19 pandemic.
india has been among the worst hit major economies due to the virus induced lockdown  with the economic growth contracting by a massive 23.
9 percent year on year  yoy  in the june 2020 quarter  the first gdp contraction in over 40 years.

the fm’s budget focused on higher spending  healthcare expenditure  infrastructure development and public sector bank privatisation  while no major income tax relief has been provided to the common man.
markets have surged nearly 4 percent particularly led by the private sector banks.
here are few post budget reactions from the india inc.
ravi s raghavan – tax counsel from majmudar   partners law firm  the consolidation of securities laws and the proposed decriminalization under the llp act marks an important move.
on the tax front  providing tax exemption for aircraft leasing companies that are set up in the ifsc has the potential to boost foreign investments.
reducing the timelines for reopening past tax cases will lead to reduced tax litigation however removing the allowability of depreciation on goodwill that had the blessings of india’s supreme court will be a major dampener for m a transactions  mr.
kamal khetan  chairman and managing director  sunteck realty   the union budget has packed some great ideas and a definite direction for strong economic growth ahead  especially through infrastructure  capital expansion and banking and financial services.
for real estate  the move to extend the tax holiday available for the purchase of affordable houses as well as for the affordable rental housing projects is a welcoming move as it would further strengthen the confidence among both developers and homebuyers.
the move will certainly prompt more demand  especially among first time buyers who generally fall in the lower and mid income segments.
also  the extension of the tax holiday on affordable housing projects for developers by another year will increase the project launches in this segment as they would get additional time and resources.
apart from this  the mega infrastructure development and upgradation to be undertaken across india will add much value to the real estate sector.
mr.
rajesh sharma  managing director  capri global capital ltd   the budget has clearly kept the focus on boosting economic growth.
emphasizing to make india self reliant and strengthen the country’s position in the global economic landscape  the honorable finance minister has given systematic importance to the nbfc sector through a slew of measures that will ease the lending business.
the reduction in the loan limit from rs 5 million to rs 2 million under the sarfaesi act for nbfcs  with a minimum asset size of rs 100cr and above  would mean that the debt recovery can enforce the security interest for lower ticket size loans.
this will help the nbfcs to improve their ability to recover smaller loans and strengthen the overall financial health.
allotment of 20  000 crores for bank recapitalization and setting up an arc to take care of npas of stressed banks and manage through alternative investment funds would securitize the irrecoverable loans.

मृगांक ने मुझे बताया कि  कलौंजी का तेल क्या है  इसके अलावा  बालों  स्कैल्प और स्किन पर इसे लगाने से क्या फायदे होते हैं। इन फायदे के बारे में जानकर आप भी इसका प्रयोग करके फायदा उठा सकते हैं।  क्या है कलौंजी का तेल   what is black seeds oil     shutterstock  कलौंजी या प्याज के बीज के तेल को प्याज के बीजों को पीसकर निकाला जाता है। प्याज के बीजों को हिंदी में कलौंजी भी कहा जाता है। कलौंजी को अंग्रेजी में कई अलग नामों से जाना जाता है।    इन बीजों को सामान्यत   black seeds  nigella sativa  black seed  black caraway  black cumin  nigella  आदि भी कहा जाता है।  भारत के अलावा कलौंजी के तेल का प्रयोग पश्चिमी एशिया  उत्तरी अफ्रीका और पूर्वी यूरोप में भी खूब किया जाता है। इसके अलावा  पारंपरिक चाइनीज दवाओं  कोरियाई दवाओं और जापानी चिकित्सा पद्यति में भी कलौंजी के तेल को बखूबी प्रयोग किया जाता है।  बालों के लिए कलौंजी का तेल  black seed oil for your hair    shutterstock  कलौंजी के तेल  black seed oil  में पाए जाने वाले प्रमुख तत्व को थाइमोक्विनॉन  thymoquinone  और नाइजिलोन  nigellone  कहा जाता है। इन दोनों हिस्टअमीन की वजह से ही कलौंजी का तेल बालों को फायदा पहुंचाता है। ये बालों को फिर से उगाने में मदद करता है।    इसके अलावा  कलौंजी तेल बालों को झड़ने से रोकने में भी मदद करता है। कलौंजी के तेल में एंटी ऑक्सीडेंट गुण भी पाए जाते हैं। ये स्कैल्प में होने वाली खुजली से भी राहत देता है। यही कारण है कि  हेयर ग्रोथ के लिए बहुत से लोग कलौंजी के तेल को बालों में भी लगाते हैं।  बालों के लिए कलौंजी के तेल के फायदे  benefits of black seed oil for hair    shutterstock  साल 2016 की स्टडी के अनुसार  कलौंजी के बीजों से निकले तेल को दवाओं और कॉस्मेटिक प्रोडक्ट्स में प्रयोग के लिए बेस्ट बताया गया है। स्टडी में कलौंजी के बीजों पर गहराई से किए गए अध्ययन के बाद पाया गया कि  कलौंजी के तेल में     एंटीबैक्टीरियल  एंटीफंगल  एंटीइन्फ्लेमेंट्री  एंटीऑक्सीडेंट  के गुण पाए जाते हैं।  ब्लैक सीड ऑयल को उपयोग करने वाले लोग मानते हैं कि  तेल के इन्हीं गुणों के कारण ये स्कैल्प की हेल्थ को मेंटेन करने में मदद कर पाता है। इसके अलावा  ये बालों और स्कैल्प से जुड़ी अन्य समस्याओं जैसे डैंड्रफ आदि को दूर करने में भी मदद कर पाता है।  कलौंजी का तेल स्कैल्प में नमी को बनाकर रखने में भी मदद करता है। लेकिन क्लिनिकल रिसर्च में ये दावा खरा नहीं पाया गया है। लेकिन  फिर भी लोग मानते हैं कि  ब्लैक सीड ऑयल के उपयोग से नमी बालों के रेशे में बनी रहती है। ऐसा इसमें पाए जाने वाले रिच अमीनो एसिड्स के कारण संभव हो पाता है।  ब्लैक सीड के ऑयल में पाए जाने वाले कुछ तत्वों के कारण इसे हेयर लॉस की समस्या को दूर करने में उपयोगी माना जाता है। हालांकि इस दावे के सम​र्थन में कुछ रिसर्च भी मौजूद हैं। लेकिन नतीजों पर विद्वानों के बीच में मतभेद हैं।  साल 2014 की स्टडी के अनुसार  कलौंजी के तेल को नारियल के तेल के साथ मिलाकर लगाने पर ये हेयर ग्रोथ को बढ़ाने में काफी हद तक कारगर साबित होता है। ये बात स्टडी के दौरान भी सही साबित पाई गई है।  इसके अलावा  साल 2017 की स्टडी में पाया गया कि  कलौंजी के तेल युक्त हर्बल हेयर ऑयल को लगाने से बालों के झड़ने की समस्या में 76 प्रतिशत तक की गिरावट दर्ज की गई थी। ये बातें ब्लैक सीड ऑयल के हेयर केयर में उपयोग को सपोर्ट करती हैं।  कौन हैं डॉ.

rural institute of medical sciences   research  यानी यूपी रिम्स से की है।    वर्तमान में वह एशिया के सबसे बड़े अस्पतालों में से एक कानपुर के लाला लाजपत राय हॉस्पिटल या हैलट अस्पताल के स्किन रोग विभाग में बतौर रेजिडेन्ट काम कर रहे हैं।  निष्कर्ष  the takeaway   स्टडी से ऐसा पता चलता है कि  ब्लैक सीड ऑयल में कई प्रकार के गुण पाए जाते हैं जो बालों की कई समस्याओं का ट्रीटमेंट कर सकते हैं। ये बालों से जुड़ी कई समस्याओं से राहत भी दे सकते हैं।  हालांकि  ब्लैक सीड ऑयल के इस्तेमाल से बालों को होने वाले फायदे पर पर्याप्त स्टडी नहीं की गई है। इसलिए  ये स्थायी रूप से नहीं कहा जा सकता है कि  इस तेल से बालों की सेहत को सुधारने वाले फायदे मिलते ही हैं।  लेकिन अभी तक हुई रिसर्च के आधार पर ये बात कही जा सकती है कि  कलौंजी का तेल हेल्दी स्कैल्प और बालों के पतलेपन की समस्या पर कारगर तरीके से काम करता है।  अगर आप भी अपने बालों पर ब्लैक सीड ऑयल को लगाना चाहते हैं तो  इसके बारे में अपने डॉक्टर से जरूर संपर्क करें। डॉक्टर ही आपको ये सलाह दे सकेगा कि कलौंजी का तेल आपके द्वारा ली जा रही किसी भी दवा के साथ रिएक्शन करेगा या नहीं।  रेफरेंस  references     ahmad a  et al.

"new delhi  twitter on monday suspended several accounts of high profile celebrities and organisations  including actor sushant singh  caravan magazine  kisan ekta morcha  tractor2twitr and several other politicians  farmer leaders  writers and activists  at the behest of the ministry of electronics and information technology  meity  for spreading misinformation during the farmers’ protests.
the it ministry and law enforcement agencies had last week ordered twitter to block these tweets and accounts under section 69a of the information technology act.
a twitter spokesperson said that many countries have laws that may apply to tweets and/or twitter account content.
in our continuing effort to make our services available to people everywhere  if we receive a properly scoped request from an authorised entity  it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time   the micro blogging platform said in a statement.
transparency is vital to protecting freedom of expression  so we have a notice policy for withheld content.
upon receipt of requests to withhold content  we will promptly notify the affected account holders  unless we are prohibited from doing so e.
g.
if we receive a court order under seal    the company informed.
twitter last week said it suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation as the farmers’ tractor rally went violent in the national capital on the 72nd republic day.
the farmers swarmed the red fort and waved farmer union flags from its ramparts.
they even hoisted farmer union flags as well as a pennant with a sikh religious symbol from a flagpole.
a twitter spokesperson told ians that the company has taken strong enforcement action to protect the conversation on the service from attempts to incite violence  abuse and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm by blocking certain terms that violate our rules for trends.
using a combination of technology and human review  twitter worked at scale and took action on hundreds of tweets that have been in violation of the twitter rules and suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation   the spokesperson informed.

"feb 01  2021  isl 7  jamshedpur fc puts winless run to bed with spectacular mobashir s goal  bambolim  goa   india   february 1   jamshedpur fc recorded a morale boosting 1 0 win against odisha fc in the ongoing seventh season of the indian super league  isl  at gmc stadium  bambolim  on monday.
mohammad mobashir rahman scored a 41st minute goal which proved to be the difference between the two sides  ending jfc s five game winless streak and keeping their playoff hopes alive.
stuart baxter made two changes from odisha s 1 1 draw against bengaluru  handing a start to bradden inman who had joined on loan from atk mohun bagan.
paul ramfangzauva was the other change in the playing xi.
for jamshedpur  centre back peter hartley returned from injury and mobashir replaced aitor monroy.
arshdeep singh has been having an excellent campaign this year for odisha and the custodian was called into action early on.
seiminlen doungel dispossessed rakesh pradhan and  on entering the penalty area  forced a save from singh.
odisha should have scored in what would have been a well worked team goal.
ramfangzauva set jerry mawihmingthanga through in the jamshedpur penalty area  and the latter beat a marker before losing possession to narender gahlot.
the ball rolled towards manuel onwu  who fumbled in front of the goal  before being cleared out for a corner.
the jamshedpur defenders were at their best despite being under a lot of pressure.
stephen eze and hartley managed to thwart the danger posed by their opponents.
going forward  their attack looked dangerous too.
doungel was impressive for jfc and may have finally found a place that could get the best out of him.
he nearly assisted a goal at the half hour mark but farukh choudhary struck over the bar.
jfc finally broke the deadlock in the 41st minute through mobashir.
the youngster put in a cross for nerijus valskis  whose movement in the box confused singh  and the ball went straight into the goal.
the odisha keeper should have done better.
doungel continued to trouble the odisha defence after the restart.
after getting the ball on the flank  he cut inside and tested singh  who pushed the ball out for a corner.
but jfc failed to take advantage of the resulting corner.
singh was called into action once again when alexandre lima tried his luck from a distance only to see his effort saved.
ofc kept attacking but poor passing in the final third saw them lose possession and hardly test the keeper.
at the other end  singh kept his side in the game with yet another save to deny choudhary.
odisha had a late penalty claim when diego mauricio was tripped in the area by tp rehenesh  but the referee turned down the appeal.

"more companies are set to benefit from a lighter compliance burden as the finance minister has proposed to revise the definition of a small company under india’s corporate laws.
also  firms will find it easier to resolve their debt  and the mergers and acquisitions space will likely see increased activity  as nirmala sitharaman said the government would introduce alternative methods of debt resolution including a special framework for micro  small and medium enterprises  along with measures to strengthen the national company law tribunals while the minister didn’t provide details of the alternative methods  the corporate affairs ministry had last month proposed a framework for pre packaged insolvency resolution  which is expected to fast track the process through out of court negotiations that will require a court approval only at the end.
as per the new definition  an organisation with a paid up capital of up to rs 2 crore and turnover of up to rs 20 crore will qualify as a small company  as opposed to the current thresholds of rs 50 lakh and rs 10 crore.
this change is expected to benefit some 200 000 companies.
with a focus on ease of doing business  the government would take up decriminalisation of compoundable offences under the limited liability partnership act  sitharaman said.
it has already done this for the companies act.
the minister also announced changes to the rules governing one person companies  opcs.
under the existing rules  such companies with a paid up capital of over rs 50 lakh or turnover exceeding rs 2 crore must convert to a normal company.
the budget has proposed to do away with these limits altogether  along with removing the restriction on non resident indians from incorporating such companies  a move which sitharaman said was expected to benefit startups.
while this may enable one person companies to scale up and enjoy simpler statutory compliances  the changes are unlikely to benefit startups much  said ankit singhi  partner at corporate professionals.
startups need to raise funds by increasing the number of board members but opcs cannot have more than one person on the board   singhi said.
according to nischal arora  partner at nangia   co  the move will encourage small unorganised sector players to conduct their businesses through a legally set up entity.
the proposed changes to opcs and the definition of small companies will require changes only to company rules and not an amendment to the law  singhi said.
the companies act prescribes a maximum paid up capital threshold of rs 10 crore and a maximum turnover threshold of rs 100 crore for small companies.
the changed definition falls within this range and will not require changes to the law   he said.

"the 5g economy will spur massive gdp and job growth across the us  copyright 2021 pr newswire.

2  2021 /prnewswire/    5g networks could create about 4.
5 million jobs in the us and add roughly  1.
5 trillion to the country s gdp  according to a new report from boston consulting group  bcg   commissioned by ctia  the wireless industry association.
bcg s analysis shows that 5g will contribute to us gdp and employment growth by enabling of innovation that will transform all sectors of america s economy across cities and communities of all sizes.
our analysis shows that the 5g economy s impact will be broad and deep  unlocking significant benefits across the us and enabling new use cases across all industries  including health care  education  and agriculture   said enrique duarte melo  a bcg managing director and senior partner and lead author of this report.
the gdp growth and job creation that america s 5g networks are beginning to unlock will be instrumental in jump starting the country s economic recovery.
bcg s research suggests that three industries  in particular  will benefit from these 5g use cases   information services  which will see job growth of 205 000 and contribute  217 billion to gdp  to gdp manufacturing  which will see a boost of 380 000 jobs and contribute  165 billion to gdp  to gdp health care  which will see 341 000 new jobs and contribute  104 billion to gdp   bcg s study confirms the significant benefits of the 5g economy  today and for years to come   said meredith attwell baker  ctia president and ceo.
with three nationwide 5g networks launched and 5g smartphones hitting the market  america s wireless industry is building the foundation for our country s economic recovery.
to bring these benefits to fruition  state  local  and federal governments must work to keep 5g s rollout on track.
delays in network infrastructure build out or in making more licensed spectrum available would carry significant opportunity costs  according to bcg s analysis.
at a national level  every six month delay in 5g network deployment could  on average  mean missing out on  25 billion of the potential 5g benefits from 2020 through 2030.

"नई दिल्ली। एक बैंक से दूसरे बैंक अकाउंट में पैसे ट्रांसफर करने के वैसे तो कई विकल्प मौजूद है। मगर इन सबके बीच rtgs सबसे पॉपुलर है। क्योंकि इसमें बड़े ट्रांजैक्शन आसानी से हो जाते हैं। पहले बैंकों की ओर से ये सुविधा निश्चित अवधि के बीच दी जाती थी  लेकिन डिजिटलाइजेशन के दौर में अब बैंक कल यानी 14 दिसंबर से रियल टाइम ग्रॉस सेटलमेंट  rtgs  को हर दिन 24 घंटे के लिए करने जा रहा है। अच्छी बात यह है कि अब आप आरटीजीएस के जरिए बड़े लेन देन घर बैठे भी कर सकेंगे। इसके लिए आपको बैंक शाखा जाने की भी जरूरत नहीं पड़ेगी।  रिजर्व बैंक के मुताबिक 14 दिसंबर की मध्य रात्रि यानी रात के 12 30 बजे से rtgs सर्विस 24 घंटे उपलब्ध होगी। ऐसा करते ही भारत दुनिया के उन चुनिंदा देशों में शामिल हो जाएगा  जहां इतने बड़े ट्रांजैक्शन 24 घंटे होते हैं। मालूम हो कि rtgs के जरिए 2 लाख रुपए से ज्यादा अमाउंट ट्रांसफर किया जा सकता है। इसे ऑनलाइन और बैंक ब्रांच दोनों माध्यम के जरिए इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं। वहीं पैसे ट्रांसफर करने की एक अन्य सर्विस neft से 2 लाख रुपए तक का ही ऑनलाइन लेन देन किया जा सकता है।  ऑनलाइन फंड ट्रांसफर पर नहीं लगेगा शुल्क  rtgs पैसे ट्रांसफर करने की सबसे तेज सर्विस है। देश के करीब 237 बैंक इस सिस्टम के माध्यम से 4.

5 करोड़ किसानों के आवेदन आते हैं। अब तक  योजना के तहत 90 000 करोड़ रुपये के दावों का भुगतान किया जा चुका है। आधार सीडिंग ने किसान के खातों में सीधे दावा निपटान में तेजी लाने में मदद की है। सरकार के अनुसार कोविड लॉकडाउन अवधि के दौरान भी लगभग 70 लाख किसानों को लाभ हुआ और इस दौरान 8741.

"the railways operating ratio is expected to improve to 96.
96 per cent by the end of the current financial year despite coronavirus related disruptions  railway board member naresh salecha said on monday.
the operating ratio means expenses as a portion of revenue or the amount spent on every rupee earned.
advertisement  salecha said as far as the finance of indian railways is concerned  its operating ratio was pegged at 96.
15 per cent for 2020 21.
this is lower than the revised estimate of 98.
36 per cent for 2019 20.
a lower operating ratio can be attributed to lower expenditure on account of a fall in working expenses as well as a sharp decline in pension liabilities.
pension liability was budgeted at rs 53 160 crore in the beginning of the current fiscal.
however  the revised estimate stood at rs 523 crore as the national transporter made an arrangement with the finance ministry to defer this expense    he said.
the railway board member noted that 2020 was an  extraordinary  and  exceptional  year due to coronavirus pandemic as a result of which passenger trains did not run.
our projections hence went haywire.
before this  we have been taking full pension liabilities.
when we could not meet such liabilities  we came to an arrangement with the finance ministry so that a separate fund could be given to us  which we have to repay to the ministry.
in a couple of years  we have to pay it back    he said.

"the uttarakhand government has started preparing for this year s char dham yatra with unique attractions for tourists and pilgrims.
on the route to the char dham shrines  the garhwal mandal vikas nigam is working on starting mobile shelters for tourists or pilgrims visiting the state.
ashish chauhan  managing director of garhwal mandal vikas nigam  gmvn  said   we had a few buses with us which we thought of utilising as mobile night shelters to give tourists a better experience.
the buses have all facilities like beds  pantry  air conditioning  washrooms  sitting area.
we are also providing tents along with the bus  for tourists who want to camp.
the buses which can accommodate three to four people will be run by drivers of the department and will have to stop near gmvn tourist rest houses   for safety of the tourists.
the mobile shelters will have to stop near gmvn rest houses as that will ensure safety of both our tourists and the vehicle.
during the stay  the shelters will get electricity connection from the rest house and the facility to refill the inbuilt water tank   added chauhan.
he further said that the mobile night shelter initiative is likely to start before the tehri lake festival scheduled to be held on february 16 17.
in a similar initiative to attract tourists  gmvn is also soon going to start a restaurant in dhanaulti  where old ambassador cars have been used for seating.
the department had some old ambassador cars which would have gone to scrap.
we thought that instead of selling them  the cars can be used to generate long term earnings for the department and started the initiative to use the old as restaurant seats.
the restaurant will be started in dhanaulti   said chauhan.
he further said that gmvn has also started an open air restaurant in mussoorie  which is getting positive feedback from tourists.

i study what rituals reveal about our minds  nature and culture.
they are not arbitrary  capricious or random.
instead  they serve critical social functions such as welcoming newborns into families  celebrating graduations and marriages and mourning loved ones who’ve died.
rituals also promote solidarity by allowing communities to express their shared goals and values.
the pandemic has forced us to change many of our most common rituals   including how we celebrate rites of passage.
baby showers  birthday parties and funerals are now held virtually.
large celebratory signs on front lawns announce graduations.
couples livestream their virtual weddings on social media  and families host holiday celebrations outdoors to ensure social distancing.
rituals around greetings and social support have also changed.
handshakes  kisses on the cheeks or lips and physical embraces have been replaced by elbow bumps  air kisses and virtual hugs.
managing uncertainty  during times of uncertainty and danger  people often use rituals to reduce their stress and exert control over their environment.
that’s why rituals are common during periods of high risk  such as during pregnancy and after giving birth.
consider chhathi  a popular ritual in northeast india that takes place on the sixth day after a child’s birth.
during the ritual ceremony  the mother and child are bathed and fed.
black thread is tied around the baby’s waist or wrist and black eyeliner is applied around the baby’s eyes.
this is meant to provide protection from supernatural threats such as the evil eye.
chhathi initiates a new baby into the family  garners supernatural protection and reinforces social cohesion within the community.
a global pandemic is also a time of significant transition and uncertainty when people have greater need for physical and social support.
over the past year  people have used electronic media to rapidly transform routine social rituals.
like the in person rituals they replaced  these new interactions – such as virtual happy hours  zoom business meetings and distance learning classrooms – strengthen social ties.
societies also use rituals for practical reasons  such as improving health and avoiding illness.
records of rituals used in medicine date back to ancient egypt and the papyrus ebers   one of the oldest known medical texts.
it includes this ritual to treat blindness  crush  powder and blend the two eyes of a pig  mineral eye salve  red oxide and wild honey in a clay bowl.
inject mixture into patient’s ear and say   i have brought this thing and put it in its place.
the crocodile god sobek is weak and powerless.
contemporary rituals are also used in this way to attempt to treat and prevent illness.
rituals called simpatias are used to treat pulmonary ailments in brazil  rituals based on traditional medicine are used to treat hiv in south africa  rituals performed during pregnancy are used to prevent birth defects in india and rituals using homoeopathic remedies are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in the u.
k.
promoting hygiene  many religious rituals concern cleansing and purification.
for example  it is obligatory for muslims to wash their face  arms  head and feet before praying  a purification ritual called wudu.
deep knowledge  daily.
sign up for the conversation’s newsletter.
the covid 19 pandemic has also prompted people to adopt new rituals around personal and communal hygiene such as wearing face masks in public  rigorously cleaning shared surfaces and taking turns being inside businesses and workplaces.
anthropologists believe such rituals may be part of a hazard precaution system   a psychological system geared toward responding to threats in the environment such as pathogens or contamination.
since reducing contamination and promoting hygiene is essential to health and survival  having rituals to spread these practices within a population is useful.
there are good reasons people spend time  money and energy engaging in rituals in the face of covid 19 restrictions.
they are essential to meeting our physical  social and psychological needs in the face of adversity.

"taiwanese chip designer mediatek has released a new 5g chip aimed at helping it gain market share in the united states.
mediatek is one of the few suppliers of modem chips that help devices such as smart phones connect to cellular data networks.
the company supplies chips to phone makers such as xiaomi and lg electronics  among others.
to date  though  mediatek’s 5g chips have been compatible with only the  sub 6  variant of 5g networks  which is the variety being widely used in countries such as china.
mediatek’s modem chip announced on monday  called the m80  will also support millimeter wave technology  which is being used by u.
s.
carriers such as verizon communications.
verizon uses the name  5g ultra wideband  for the service.
qualcomm is currently the dominant supplier of chips to take advantage of the millimeter wave technology  with its chips used in the u.
s.
versions of apple’s iphone 12 5g smartphone.
finbarr moynihan  general manager of international corporate sales  said that mediatek hopes to win more contracts to supply chips for u.
s.
models  reuters reported.
it’s a very different market  in terms of the operator landscape and the technology requirements  but we’ve been very pleased to some solid progress in our volume and market share  with handset makers such as samsung and lg  finbarr moynihan said.
as 5g rollouts accelerate  mmwave is becoming increasingly important  especially in the u.
s.
mediatek’s new 5g modem integrates support for both sub 6 ghz and mmwave networks to address this opportunity and give device makers more flexibility   said jc hsu  corporate vice president of mediatek’s wireless communications business unit.
mediatek’s 5g modems are suitable for advanced devices  including smartphones  pcs  mi fi hotspots  broadband customer premise equipment  cpe   industrial iot applications and more.
mediatek’s first generation 5g modem  the m70  is built into mediatek’s dimensity chipsets for 5g smartphones.
the company’s 5g portfolio also includes the mediatek t700  which will power 5g pcs set to hit the market in 2021  along with mediatek’s t750 chipset for 5g fixed wireless access routers  fwa  and mobile hotspot devices.

covaxine को सरकार की मंजूरी के बाद विशेषज्ञों के बीच बहस शुरू  सरकार के दवा नियामक ने रविवार को ही आक्सफोर्ड एस्ट्राजेनेका की वैक्सीन कोविशील्ड और स्वदेशी टीके कोवैक्सीन को मंजूरी दी है। हालांकि कोवैक्सीन के सुरक्षित होने और कारगरता को लेकर अभी पूरा डाटा भी उपलब्ध नहीं है। ऐसे में विशेषज्ञों के बीच बहस शुरू हो गई है। भारत बायोटेक की कोरोना वैक्सीन कोवैक्सीन की कारगरता और सुरक्षा को लेकर सरकार की ओर से किए दावों पर विशेषज्ञों ने प्रश्न उठाए हैं। सरकार ने दावा किया है कि कोवैक्सीन कोरोना के नए स्ट्रेन  रूप  का भी मुकाबला कर सकती है। आल इंडिया इंस्टीट्यूट आफ मेडिकल साइंसेज  एम्स  के निदेशक रणदीप गुलेरिया ने सोमवार को कहा कि अगर मामलों में उछाल आता है तो हमें ज्यादा डोज की जरूरत होगी। ऐसे में हम भारत बायोटेक की कोवैक्सीन का इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं। जहां तक सुरक्षा का सवाल है किसी भी क्लीनिकल ट्रायल में जल्दबाजी नहीं की गई है। हां नियामक से मंजूरी लेने में जरूर तत्परता बरती गई है जिसके लिए सामान्य तौर पर बहुत समय लगता है। विख्यात वायरोलाजिस्ट शाहिद जमील ने कहा कि   मुझे नहीं लगता कि यह वैक्सीन सुरक्षित साबित होगी या यह 70 फीसद से अधिक कारगर होगी।  उन्होंने कहा कि वैक्सीन के बारे में जो दावे किए गए हैं वे भारत बायोटेक के इनएक्टीवेटेड वायरल वैक्सीन बनाने के सफल रिकार्ड पर आधारित हैं।  icmr के महानिदेशक बलराम भार्गव ने रविवार को कहा था कि कोवैक्सीन मृत कोरोना वायरस पर आधारित है। यह ब्रिटेन में पाए गए नए स्ट्रेन समेत कोरोना के सभी रूपों का मुकाबला करने में सक्षम है। इसी वजह से इसे सशर्त इस्तेमाल की मंजूरी दी गई है। हालांकि उन्होंने यह भी कहा था कि वैक्सीन की कारगरता को लेकर अभी स्पष्ट डाटा उपलब्ध नहीं है।  posted by  navodit saktawat  नईदुनिया ई पेपर पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करे  नईदुनिया ई पेपर पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करे  डाउनलोड करें नईदुनिया ऐप   पाएं मध्यप्रदेश  छत्तीसगढ़ और देश दुनिया की सभी खबरों के साथ नईदुनिया ई पेपर राशिफल और कई फायदेमंद सर्विसेस  डाउनलोड करें नईदुनिया ऐप   पाएं मध्यप्रदेश  छत्तीसगढ़ और देश दुनिया की सभी खबरों के साथ नईदुनिया ई पेपर राशिफल और कई फायदेमंद सर्विसेस,covaxine debates between experts after the government s approval

"what are floating rate funds   floating rate fund is a category of fund that aims to invest a minimum of 65  in floating rate securities.
since there are not too many issuances of floating rate securities  funds in this category may make use of a derivative strategy to comply with the 65  requirement of investment in floating rate instrument by combining fixed rate bonds with swaps  like overnight index swap.
what is the strategy of the idfc floating rate fund   the fund currently will have a low to short duration such that it is suitable for a minimum recommended investment horizon of six months.
the fund is proposed under the satellite bucket offering which means it will not run a constrained duration or constrained credit risk strategy.
currently the fund proposes to have some allocation to sub aaa securities including additional tier 1  basel iii  bonds of higher rated psu/private banks.
the fund aims to maintain a minimum of 70  in aaa/a1 equivalent/sovereign/quasi sovereign securities  at the time of investment.
further the fund does not aim to invest in securities rated lower than aa   at the point of investment.
the fund will endeavour to generate relatively stable returns through investment in a portfolio comprising substantially of floating rate debt  fixed rate debt instruments swapped for floating rate returns and money market instruments.
what is the positioning of the fund   why is idfc mutual fund launching this fund now   in our view  following are some cyclical factors that could turn out to be potential tailwinds for us   stress on banking balance sheet seems to be stabilizing as recognition and provisioning seem to be finally ahead of formation.
manufacturing segment may get a boost from the corporate tax cuts announced earlier alongside a robust production incentive scheme roll out  and improving global trade.
government revenues are likely to also see a cyclical upswing thus enabling a more robust spending program ahead.
some revival in the real estate sector could feed into better employment prospects via a construction cycle.
monetary policy is genuinely accommodative.
however  income slowdown cycle needs to be reversed and the elements of permanent damage to smaller balance sheets need to be controlled for sustenance of a cyclical rebound.
please refer our detailed annual note here  https //idfcmf.
com/article/3568  who should invest in this fund   investors seeking lower investment horizon in satellite bucket  investors seeking to diversify their current fixed income portfolio  investors seeking relatively stable returns over a short period of time  note  satellite bucket  the bucket consists of funds that can take higher risk –either duration risk or credit risk or both.
what are the risks one should be aware of when investing in idfc floating rate fund   the fund follows a diluted credit strategy and therefore is positioned in the satellite bucket  has higher credit risk versus core bucket   the fund may invest in floating rate bonds or create synthetic floaters using interest rate swaps  irs.
this may not provide a complete hedge against interest rate rise owing to basis risk  different tenor of swaps and bonds  amongst other factors.
any fixed income fund may be prone to credit risk  liquidity risk  interest rate risk  re investment risk  etc.
what are the key details of the nfo of idfc floating rate fund   what is the product label and riskometer of the fund   this product is suitable for investors who are seeking    to generate short term optimal returns  to invest predominantly in floating rate instruments   investors should consult their financial advisers if in doubt about whether the product is suitable for them.

"the finance minister has delivered a truly many splendored budget that ticks all possible boxes that i can think of.
of the 3 ‘a’s i assign to it  the first a is for boldness.
the budget goes where no previous one has gone before  it has announced it will privatize two public sector banks.
hitherto governments both upa and nda  have looked at psu banks as a kitty to fund their favorite projects or psu bankers as a bunch of central government officers who will do their bidding in the states.
this forthright announcement that two banks will be privatized has pushed up shares of all psu banks.
the market  expectedly  is guessing that the end game for more and more psu banks could be privatization.
thus  merely by announcing intent  the government has made it easier for all psu banks to raise capital at better prices  thus lessening the need for capitalization.
excellent thinking   the second instance of bold thinking is the announcement of an asset reconstruction company that will assume all the stressed assets of banks and sell them to alternative investment funds.
while details are still sparse or nil  the intent is good enough to make investors keen to own psu bank shares which again solves the problem of capitalizing these banks.
the government also deserves an a for promising to improve the working of the nclt  which probably implies passing the amendment to allow pre packs  or pre decided resolution packages for smaller companies  that require only a quick nod from the nclt.
net net  the efforts to clean up banks is sincere  imaginative and many sided.
my second a for the budget is for transparency.
the government has rightly brought extra budgetary borrowing into the budget.
this is most obvious in the food subsidy which hitherto was being financed by the fci borrowing from the nssf.
the onboarding of these expenses onto the budget won’t burden the government because now more is available to it from the nssf for other programs.
a 9.
5 percent deficit for fy21 and 6.
8 percent deficit for fy22 is huge  but not if it is mostly acknowledging the debt that the government was anyways holding under a different heading called ebr.
the third a for restraint   for want of another word  is for the government not making outlandish assumptions.
quite contrary to previous budgets  the government is assuming that tax revenues will grow at the same pace as the nominal gdp  around 14.
4 percent.
and the nominal gdp growth assumption itself is less than that of most economists  which is again a show of remarkable restraint.
the government could easily have assumed a 16 percent nominal gdp and a 20 percent tax revenue growth  thus cutting down the fiscal deficit to 5.
5 percent.
the restraint is admirable.
so  what are the risks then  the 9.
2 lakh crore government borrowing through bonds is certainly a risk  but given that credit growth is still only slowly crawling up and the rbi still has the elbow room to help with omos  open market operations   this is perhaps the right time to announce a large borrowing program.
the bond market has shown its displeasure by pushing up yields  but it may not push much harder given that rbi could jump in and buy and leave them with losses  especially now that inflation is set to recede for the next couple of months.
even for the rest of the year  the base case is the rbi should be able to manage.
even after the government’s stated glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit over 5 years  the deficit comes down to only 4percentby 2026.
this leaves open the danger of high debt to gdp ratio for a few years.
and if inflation and interest rates were to flare up and growth not obliged  there is the making of a debt trap here.
growth simply has to kick in  else we are in trouble.
the second risk is if an external crisis manifests before growth picks up sustainably.
in such a case  the economy can be close to what it was in 2013 when the taper tantrum roiled us.
to be fair  this is by no means the base case now.
a third risk is that of a rating downgrade.
the government may have assessed this as  unlikely.
but should a downgrade come  the debt markets may still be safe  since foreign funds haven’t been buying indian debt at all.
the worry will be if any equity funds follow ratings in their investments.
while the budget announcements get a aaa  on implementation one has to reserve one’s judgment.
privatizing banks  completing the ipo of lic  setting up the arc  sprucing up the nclt to resolve stressed loans of msmes are all laudable but very tough proposals.
they require well drafted legislation  intelligent financial design  and persuading many constituencies like unions to play ball.
delay  defective design  or trust deficit can kill these plans.
the current finance ministry has rendered a good account of itself in the past one year on implementation  be it the credit guarantee for msmes or the designing of the pli  production linked incentive  schemes or the food transfer schemes.
let us hope they will continue the good run in these far more challenging proposals.
stay tuned with all the live action and updates with our budget 2021 live blog.

"samsung ने कुछ समय पहले भारत में 7 000mah बैटरी के साथ galaxy m51 स्मार्टफ़ोन लॉन्च किया था.
ये फ़ोन मिड रेंज ही है  लेकिन इसकी पावरफुल बैटरी इसे ख़ास बनाती है.
galaxy m51 के इस रिव्यू में आप इस फ़ोन के रियल टाइम यूज के बारे में पढ़ेंगे.
कैसा परफ़ॉर्म करता है ये फ़ोन  डिस्प्ले  बिल्ड क्वॉलिटी और कैमरा से लेकर बैटरी बैकअप के बारे में.
galaxy m51 डिज़ाइन  डिस्प्ले और बिल्ड क्वॉलिटी  galaxy m51 के डिज़ाइन में कुछ नया नहीं है.
galaxy m सीरीज़ के फ़ोन ऐसे ही होते हैं.
ग्लास्टिक बॉडी है.
फ़ोन भारी है और थिक भी है.
galaxy m51 का रियर पैनल फ़िंगरप्रिंट मैग्नेट है और इसमें स्क्रैच जल्दी लगते हैं.
अगर आप बिना कवर के इस्तेमाल करेंगे तो कुछ समय यूज के बाद इसमें स्क्रैच दिखने लगेंगे.
फ़ोन होल्ड करने में आसान है और एक हाथ से फ़ोन यूज किया जा सकता है.
ख़राब बात ये है कि इसके साथ बॉक्स में आपको कवर नहीं मिलता है.
कंपनी दूसरे चुनिंदा स्मार्टफोन्स के साथ कवर देती है.
फ़ोन की बिल्ड क्वॉलिटी बच्ची है और बॉटम में usb type c पोर्ट मिलता है.
फ़ोन में हेडफ़ोन जैक भी है और यहीं स्पीकर ग्रिल दिए गए है.
पावर बटन में ही फ़िंगरप्रिंट स्कैनर दिया गया है जो सटीक काम करता है.
galaxy m51 डिस्प्ले  galaxy m51 में 6.
7 इंच की बड़ी सुपर amoled डिस्प्ले दी गई है.
ऐस्पेक्ट रेश्यो 20 9 का है और फ़ुल एचडी प्लस रेज्योलुशन है.
इसमें gorilla glass 3 दिया गया है जो काफ़ी पुराना हो चुका है और इससे ज़्यादा प्रोटेक्शन की उम्मीद नहीं कर सकते हैं.
फ़ोन की डिस्प्ले शानदार है और इसमें वीडियोज देखने का हमारा अनुभव अच्छा रहा है.
गेमिंग भी इस फ़ोन से आराम से कर सकते हैं और इसमें इसकी बढ़िया डिस्प्ले का फ़ायदा मिलता है.
सैमसंग के amoled पैनल यूज करने का अनुभव हमेशा से ही बेहतर रहा है.
कलर्स अच्छे दिखते हैं और डिस्प्ले पर्याप्त ब्राइट है कि आउटडोर में भी इसे यूज किया जा सके.
यहाँ डिस्प्ले में हाई रिफ़्रेश रेट नहीं मिलता है और इसमें स्टैंडर्ड 60hz ही है.
कंपनी इसमें हाई रिफ़्रेश रेट देती कम से कम 90hz तो बेहतर होता.
galaxy m51   परफ़ॉर्मेंस  galaxy m51 में exynos नहीं  बल्कि यहाँ qualcomm snapdragon 730g प्रोसेसर दिया गया है.
ये 8 नैनोमीटर प्रोसेस पर बना हुआ चिपसेट है.
इस प्रोसेसर वाले कई स्मार्टफोन्स का रिव्यू मैंने किया है और इस आधार पर ये कह सकता हूँ कि ये प्रोसेसर डिसेंट है.
इसके साथ कंपनी ने adreno 618 gpu दिया गया है.
इस फ़ोन को आप 6g या 8gb रैम वेरिएंट के साथ ख़रीद सकते हैं.
8gb रैम वेरिएंट बेहतर होगा परफ़ॉर्मेंस के मामले में.
डेली यूज के दौरान फ़ोन ज़रूरी टास्क अच्छे से हैंडल करता है.
फ़ोन में android 10 बेस्ड कंपनी का कस्टम ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम दिया गया है.
इस फ़ोन में कुछ प्री इंस्टॉल्ड ऐप्स भी दिए गए हैं.
इस ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम के साथ भी हमारा एक्सपीरिएंस अच्छा रहा है.
मल्टी टास्किंग के दौरान आपको इसमें कोई समस्या नहीं आएगा.
एक ऐसे से दूसरे ऐप में स्विच करना फ़ास्ट है.
ऐप लोड होने में ज़्यादा समय नहीं लगता है.
यहाँ 90hz रिफ़्रेश रेट की कमी ज़रूर फ़ील होती है.
galaxy m51 में आप गेमिंग भी कर सकते हैं और पावरफुल बैटरी होने का यहाँ पूरा फ़ायदा मिलता है.
क्योंकि लंबे समय तक आप बैटरी ड्रेन होने की चिंता किए बिना लगातार गेमिंग कर सकते हैं.
गेमिंग में लैग्स नहीं हैं  लेकिन देर तक गेम खेलने के बाद फ़ोन गर्म होता है.
फ़ोन की डिस्प्ले अच्छी होने की भी फ़ायदा यहाँ मिलता है.
ओवरऑल इस फ़ोन की परफ़ॉर्मेंस ऐवरेज से बेहतर है.
galaxy m51 कैमरा  galaxy m51 में चार रियर कैमरे दिए गए हैं.
प्राइमरी लेंस 64 मेगापिक्सल का है और यहाँ कंपनी ने imx682 सेंसर का यूज किया गया है.
दूसरा कैमरा 12 मेगापिक्सलका है जो अल्ट्रा वाइड है.
5 मेगापिक्सल का डेप्थ सेंसर है  जबकि 5 मेगापिक्सल का मैक्रो लेंस है.
सेल्फ़ी के लिए इसमें 32 मेगापिक्सल का सेंसर दिया गया है.
प्राइमरी कैमरे से अच्छी फोटॉग्रफी होती है.
इसमें आपको कुछ फ़्लैगशिप सैमसंग स्मार्टफोन्स के कैमरा फ़ीचर्स मिल जाएँगे.
जैसे single take   ये फीचर अच्छा काम करता है.
सिंगल टेक से बेस्ट फ़ोटो  वीडियो  स्लो मोशन  टाइम लैप्स और ग्रे स्केल तस्वीर में से एक सेलेक्ट कर सकते हैं.
ये हाई एंड सैमसंग स्मार्टफ़ोन का फ़ीचर है और आपके लिए ये बेहतरीन काम करेगा.
कैमरा इंरफेस स्टैंडर्ड है और इसमें कई तरह के मोड्स दिए गए हैं.
कैमरे में कई तरह के फिल्टर्स दिए गए हैं जिन्हें यूज कर सकते हैं.
पर्सनली मुझे ज़्यादातर स्टिकर्स यूजलेस ही लगते हैं.
ओवरऑल कुछ दिन के यूज पर ये कहा जा सकता है कि इस फ़ोन का कैमरा ऐवरेज से थोड़ा बेटर है  लेकिन इसे और बेहतर किया जा सकता था.
galaxy m51  बैटरी  galaya m51 की बैटरी 7 000mah की है.
इस सेग्मेंट ये बैटरी शायद ही आपको मार्केट में मिलेगी.
फ़ोन की बैटरी बड़ी होने की वजह से ये फ़ोन थोड़ा मोटा और भारी भी लगता है.
25w फ़ास्ट चार्ज दिया गया है और इसके साथ usb type c दिया गया है.
फोन तेज़ी से चार्ज होता है  लेकिन ये ज़्यादा फ़ास्ट नहीं है  फ़ुल चार्ज होने में समय लगता है.
इस फोन में रिवर्स चार्जिंग का सपोर्ट है यानी इसे पावर बैंक की तरह यूज करते हुए दूसरे फ़ोन भी चार्ज कर सकेंगे.
देखें  आजतक live tv  ऐवरेज यूज में ये फ़ोन 2 दिन तक आप आराम से चला लेंगे.
मिक्स्ड यूज में भी ये एक दिन का बैकअप आराम से देता है.
फ़ोन की स्क्रीन टाइम अगर 10 से 12 घंटे भी है तो आपको चिंता करने की ज़रूरत नहीं है अगर ये फ़ुल चार्ज है.
बॉटम लाइन  galaxy m51 निश्चित तौर पर एक हेवी बैटरी बैकअप वाला फ़ोन है.
लेकिन इसके अलावा भी इसका परफ़ॉर्मेंस और कैमरा इसे ख़रीदने लायक़ बनाता है.
डिज़ाइन में कुछ अलग चाहिए  फ़ोन हल्का या पतला चाहिए या हेवी यूज के लिए चाहिए तो आपके पास दूसरे ऑप्शन भी मौजूद हैं.

"jamshedpur fc recorded a morale boosting 1 0 win against odisha fc in the ongoing seventh season of the indian super league  isl  at gmc stadium  bambolim  on monday.
mohammad mobashir rahman scored a 41st minute goal which proved to be the difference between the two sides  ending jfc s five game winless streak and keeping their playoff hopes alive.
stuart baxter made two changes from odisha s 1 1 draw against bengaluru  handing a start to bradden inman who had joined on loan from atk mohun bagan.
paul ramfangzauva was the other change in the playing xi.
for jamshedpur  centre back peter hartley returned from injury and mobashir replaced aitor monroy.
arshdeep singh has been having an excellent campaign this year for odisha and the custodian was called into action early on.
seiminlen doungel dispossessed rakesh pradhan and  on entering the penalty area  forced a save from singh.
odisha should have scored in what would have been a well worked team goal.
ramfangzauva set jerry mawihmingthanga through in the jamshedpur penalty area  and the latter beat a marker before losing possession to narender gahlot.
the ball rolled towards manuel onwu  who fumbled in front of the goal  before being cleared out for a corner.
the jamshedpur defenders were at their best despite being under a lot of pressure.
stephen eze and hartley managed to thwart the danger posed by their opponents.
going forward  their attack looked dangerous too.
doungel was impressive for jfc and may have finally found a place that could get the best out of him.
he nearly assisted a goal at the half hour mark but farukh choudhary struck over the bar.
jfc finally broke the deadlock in the 41st minute through mobashir.
the youngster put in a cross for nerijus valskis  whose movement in the box confused singh  and the ball went straight into the goal.
the odisha keeper should have done better.
doungel continued to trouble the odisha defence after the restart.
after getting the ball on the flank  he cut inside and tested singh  who pushed the ball out for a corner.
but jfc failed to take advantage of the resulting corner.
singh was called into action once again when alexandre lima tried his luck from a distance only to see his effort saved.
ofc kept attacking but poor passing in the final third saw them lose possession and hardly test the keeper.
at the other end  singh kept his side in the game with yet another save to deny choudhary.
odisha had a late penalty claim when diego mauricio was tripped in the area by tp rehenesh  but the referee turned down the appeal.

"galaxy s20 fe  फ्लैगशिप लेवल एक्सपिरिएंस.
इस रिव्यू में पढ़ें इसकी खूबियां और कमियां.
.
galaxy s20 fe review  अगर आप बजट से बाहर होने की वजह से galaxy s20  या note 20 ultra नहीं ख़रीद पा रहे हैं तो ये फ़ोन आपके लिए है.
लेकिन इसकी कुछ कमियाँ भी हैं.
पढ़ें इस रिव्यू में.
स्टोरी हाइलाइट्सgalaxy s20 fe review  फोन कॉम्पैक्ट  प्रीमियम और गुड लुकिंग है.
galaxy s20 fe में तीन रियर कैमरे और 120hz की डिस्प्ले दी गई है.
साउथ कोरियन टेक्नोलॉजी कंपनी samsung ने हाल ही में भारत में galaxy s20 fe लॉन्च किया है.
यहाँ fe का मतलब fan edition.
इसमें फ़ैन एडिशन जैसा क्या है ये तो हमें समझ नहीं आया.
भारत में ये फ़ोन उतना सस्ता भी नहीं है जिसकी वजह से इसे फ़ैन एडिशन कहा गया.
बहरहाल आपको हम galaxy s20 fe का रिव्यू बता रहे हैं.
इस रिव्यू के बाद आप ये तय कर पाने की स्थिति में होंगे की आपको ये स्मार्टफ़ोन ख़रीदना चाहिए या नहीं.
galaxy s20 fe   डिज़ाइन और बिल्ड क्वॉलिटीgalaxy s20 fe का मैंने मिंट ग्रीन कलर वेरिएंट रिव्यू किया है.
इसे कंपनी ने छह कलर वेरिएंट्स के साथ लॉन्च किया है.
फ़ोन प्रीमियम लगता है और इसका बैक पैनल प्लास्टिक का ही है.
फ़ोन ग्लास मेटल का बना है और रियर पैनल पर ऊभरा हुआ कैमरा मॉड्यूल दिया गया है.
galaxy note 20 ultra में जिस तरह का कैमरा बंप देखने को मिलता है  galaxy s20 fe में उसी तरह का कैमरा बंप है.
देखने में एक जैसा ही लगता है  लेकिन फ़र्क़ ये है कि इसमें तीन रियर कैमरे ही हैं.
headtopics.
com  फ़ोन को होल्ड करने में ग्रिप अच्छी बनती है.
फ़ोन का रियर पैनल फ़िंगरप्रिंट मैगनेट नहीं है  इसलिए बिना कवर के यूज करने पर भी फ़ोन गंदा नहीं दिखता है.
galaxy s20 fe में हेडफ़ोन जैक नहीं है और बॉट में यूएसबी टाइप सी जैक के बग़ल में स्पीकर ग्रिल दिया गया है.
रियर पैनल कर्व्ड है और ये फ़ोन यूज करने में बेहद कॉम्पैक्ट लगता है.
आप इसे एक हाथ से आराम से यूज कर सकते हैं.
फ़ोन का ओवरऑल लुक और फ़ील सॉलिड और प्रीमियम है.
ये फ़्लैगशिप डिवाइसेज से किसी भी तरह कम नहीं लगता है.
galaxy s20 fe डिस्प्लेgalaxy s20 fe में कर्व्ड डिस्प्ले के बजाए कंपनी ने 6.
5 इंच का फ़्लैट डिस्प्ले ही देने का फ़ैसला किया है.
ये सुपर amoled पैनल है और ऐस्पेक्ट रेश्यो 20 9 का है.
इसका रेज्योलुशन फ़ुल एचडी प्लस है.
अच्छी बात ये है कि इस फ़ोन में आपको 120hz की रिफ़्रेश रेट मिलता है.
जिससे ये फ़ोन ज़्यादा फ़ास्ट फ़ील होता है.
लेकिन इसमें आपको सैमसंग के प्लैगशिप की तरह quad hd  का ऑप्शन नहीं मिलता है.
डिस्प्ले ब्राइट और कलरफुल है  व्यूइंग एंगल भी ठीक है और डायरेक्ट सनलाइट में भी इसके कंटेंट विजिबल रहते हैं.
डिस्प्ले कॉन्ट्रास्ट भी उम्मीद पर खरा उतरता है.
अगर आप इसकी डिस्प्ले को galaxy s20  से कंपेयर करेंगे तो इसमें वो फ़ील नहीं मिलती है.
इसमें hdr  नहीं है  बल्कि hdr 10 दिया गया है.
कुल मिला कर ये है कि इसकी डिस्प्ले बेहतरीन है  लेकिन सेग्मेंट बेस्ट नहीं.
galaxy s20 fe परफ़ॉर्मेंसgalaxy s20 fe में qualcomm का प्रोसेसर नहीं है.
भारत में आम तौर पर कंपनी qualcomm प्रोसेसर वाले फ्लैगशिप फोन नहीं लाती है.
headtopics.
com  इसी तरह galaxy s20 fe में भी क्वॉल्कॉम का प्रोसेसर नहीं है.
इसमें exynos 990 प्रोसेसर दिया गया है जो कंपनी का अपना है.
इस फ़ोन के इंटरनेशनल वेरिएंट में snapdragon 865 प्रोसेसर दिया गया है.
galaxy s20 fe में 8gb रैम के साथ 128gb और 258gb स्टोरेज वेरिएंट का ऑप्शन है.
फ़ोन में android 10 बेस्ड ui 2.
5 दिया गया है.
फ़ोन फ़ास्ट है  हैंग नहीं करता  लैग भी नोटिस नहीं करेंगे.
लेकिन galaxy note 20 ultra की तरह ये फ़ोन भी हेवी यूज या गेमिंग के दौरान गर्म होता है.
हालाँकि फ़ोन इतना भी गर्म नहीं होता कि आप इसे यूज नहीं कर पाएं और ये जल्द ही नॉर्मल भी हो जाता है.
डेली टास्क  गेमिंग  वीडियो से लेकर ब्राउज़िंग हर तरह के टास्क आराम से परफ़ॉर्म करता है.
galaxy s20 fe का ओवरऑल परफ़ॉर्मेंस अच्छा है और हमें रिव्यू के दौरान इसमें हीटिंग के अलावा और कोई दिक़्क़त पेश नहीं आई है.
galaxy s20 fe कैमराgalaxy s20 fe में तीन रियर कैमरे दिए गए हैं.
वर्टिकल कैमरा सेटअप है और मॉड्यूल उभरा हुआ है.
मुख्य कैमरा 12 मेगापिक्सल का है  12 मेगापिक्सल का अल्ट्रा वाइड लेंस है और 8 मेगापिक्सल का टेलीफ़ोटो लेंस दिया गया है.
दो कैमरे जो हैं वही कैमरा आपको galaxy s20 और galaxy s20  में भी मिलते हैं.
galaxy s20 fe से क्लिक की गई तस्वीरों में पर्याप्त डीटेल्स देखने को मिलेगा.
आउटडोर या इनडोर दोनों जगहों पर इससे आप अच्छी तस्वीरें क्लिक कर सकते हैं.
पोर्ट्रेड मोड पर क्लिक की गई तस्वीरें अच्छी आती हैं  ज़ूम मोड पर क्लिक की गई तस्वीरें प्रभावित नहीं करती हैं.
इसमें 3x हाईब्रिड जूम है.
headtopics.
com  फ़ोटोज़ में कलर्स अच्छे दिखते हैं  सटीक भी हैं  लेकिन फ़ोटो वॉर्म लगते हैं.
इसके अपने फ़ायदे और नुक़सान भी हैं.
वीडियो रिकॉर्डिंग का जहां तक सवाल है तो galaxy s20 fe के साथ आपको 4k रिकॉर्डिंग का ऑप्शन मिलता है.

"मोबाइल चिप बनाने वाली कंपनी qualcomm ने दिसंबर 2020 में अपना फ्लैगशिप snapdragon 888 प्रोसेसर लॉन्च किया था.
ये चिप इस साल यानी कि 2021 में आने वाले फ्लैगशिप एंड्रॉयड फोन में इस्तेमाल की जाएगी.
मगर हाल ही में कंपनी ने एक और फ्लैगशिप चिप लॉन्च कर दी.
नाम है स्नैपड्रैगन 870.
ऐसे में ये कंफ्यूज़न हो गया है कि कौन सा प्रोसेसर इस साल के फ्लैगशिप फोन में नज़र आएगा  इस सवाल का जवाब देने के साथ आइए आपको ये भी बताते हैं कि इन दोनों चिप में क्या फ़र्क है और आपके फोन में लगने से क्या कुछ बदलेगा.
स्नैपड्रैगन 888 बढ़िया या 870   स्नैपड्रैगन 888 और स्नैपड्रैगन 870 में लगभग उतना ही फ़र्क है  जितना स्नैपड्रैगन 888 और स्नैपड्रैगन 865  में.
बस नया वाला चिप पुराने वाले स्नैपड्रैगन 865  से स्पीड में थोड़ा ज्यादा है.
इसलिए sd888 को और sd870 को कंपेयर करना ऐसा ही होगा जैसे sd865  को sd888 से कंपेयर किया जाए.
इस फ़र्क को इन पॉइंट्स के जरिए अच्छे से समझिए.
परफॉर्मेंस   स्नैपड्रैगन 865  चिप में सिंगल कोर परफॉर्मेंस 3.
1ghz है.
और स्नैपड्रैगन 870 में ये 3.
2 ghz है.
इसके उलट स्नैपड्रैगन 888 में पूरा का पूरा cpu ही बदला हुआ है  जो एक नए आर्किटेक्चर पर बना है.
स्नैपड्रैगन 888 ज्यादा अच्छा परफॉर्मेंस देगा  इस बात में कोई शक नहीं है.
ग्राफिक्स   ग्राफिक प्रोसेसिंग के लिए स्नैपड्रैगन 870 में पुराना वाला adreno 650 gpu लगा हुआ है  जबकि स्नैपड्रैगन 888 में नया वाला adreno 660 gpu लगा है.
gpu से आपके फ़ोन की गेमिंग परफॉर्मेंस तय होती है.
साइज   क़्वालकॉम के पिछली जेनरेशन के प्रोसेसर की तरह स्नैपड्रैगन 870 7nm प्रोसेस पर बना है.
और स्नैपड्रैगन 888 चिप 5nm प्रोसेस पर बना है.
ये नया प्रोसेस है और ऐपल आईफोन 12 सीरीज़ में लगा हुआ a14 चिप का साइज़ भी 5nm है.
चिप का साइज़ जितना छोटा है  वो उतना ही अच्छा परफॉर्मेंस देता है.
मॉडम   स्नैपड्रैगन 888 में एक जुड़ा हुआ x60 मॉडम लगा हुआ है जबकि स्नैपड्रैगन 870 में इक्स्टर्नल x55 मॉडम लगा होता है.
sd888 में जुड़े हुए मॉडम की वजह से ये पावर ज्यादा बचाएगा.
चार्जिंग   स्नैपड्रैगन 888 प्रोसेसर quickcharge 5 के सपोर्ट के साथ आता है  और स्नैपड्रैगन 870 पुराने वाले quickcharge 4  के सपोर्ट के साथ.
मतलब कि अगर फोन बनाने वाला चाहे तो स्नैपड्रैगन 888 वाले फोन में एक्स्ट्रा फ़ास्ट बैटरी चार्जिंग सिस्टम लगा सकता है.
कैमरा  इसके अलावा स्नैपड्रैगन 888 अपने ai इंजन और कैमरा इम्प्रूव्मेन्ट की वजह से स्नैपड्रैगन 870 से काफ़ी आगे निकल जाता है.
तो ये बात तो साफ़ है कि स्नैपड्रैगन 888 प्रोसेसर वाले फ़ोन स्नैपड्रैगन 870 वाले फोन से कहीं ज्यादा अच्छे होंगे.
स्नैपड्रैगन 870 क्यों लाए और किन फोन में लगेगा   अब अपने शुरुआती सवाल पर आते हैं.
जब क़्वालकॉम ने 2021 के फ्लैगशिप फोन में लगने वाला चिप पहले ही लॉन्च कर दिया था  तो फ़िर इस नए चिप की क्या जरूरत  इसका छोटा सा जवाब है  सस्ते फ्लैगशिप फोन को पावर देने के लिए.
क़्वालकॉम का फ्लैगशिप प्रोसेसर काफ़ी महंगा पड़ता है.
इसीलिए फ्लैगशिप एंड्रॉयड फोन भी बहुत महंगे होते हैं.
इस साल के स्नैपड्रैगन 888 प्रोसेसर वाले फोन  पिछले साल के स्नैपड्रैगन 865 या 865  चिप से लैस डिवाइस से कहीं ज्यादा कीमत के होंगे.
ऐसे में स्नैपड्रैगन 870 चिप ऐसे फ्लैगशिप लेवल के फ़ोन बनाने में मदद करेगा  जिनकी कीमत थोड़ी कम हो.
अब हर कोई तो 40 000 रुपए या उससे ऊपर के डिवाइस नहीं खरीद सकता  ऐसे में sd870 वाले फोन एक अच्छा ऑप्शन बनकर सामने आएंगे.
ये फोन स्नैपड्रैगन 888 वाले फोन से परफॉर्मेंस में काफ़ी पीछे होंगे  मगर क़्वालकॉम के मिड रेंज चिप के मुकाबले काफ़ी अच्छे होंगे.
उम्मीद है कि शाओमी  रियलमी और मोटोरोला जैसे ब्रांड स्नैपड्रैगन 888 से लैस प्रीमियम फोन तो बनाएंगे ही  साथ में स्नैपड्रैगन 870 की मदद से सस्ते फ्लैगशिप एंड्रॉयड फोन भी लॉन्च करेंगे.
बस इस बात का ध्यान रखिएगा कि अगर आपके पास पहले से स्नैपड्रैगन 865/ 865  चिप से लैस फोन है तो सिर्फ प्रोसेसर बदलने के लिए स्नैपड्रैगन 870 वाला फोन मत लीजिएगा.
क्योंकि इन दोनों चिप का नाम भले ही बदला हुआ हो  sd870 असल में बस थोड़ी सी ज्यादा स्पीड वाला sd865  चिप ही है.

"samsung has been taking on apple head on for the last decade with the galaxy s series.
over the years  the galaxy brand has become a powerful one which has sold more than 2 billion phones.
but in recent years  samsung has been shown up by just not only apple but other android brethren.
the galaxy s20 ultra was an audacious effort to pull samsung ahead of the pack  but it backfired.
the s20 ultra had a litany of issues    from its disgraceful camera to overcooked processor to its hideous design.
the galaxy s21 ultra  thankfully  redeems all these mistakes in one swift move making it the most complete android smartphone i have tested in a year.
sure  there will be others that may one up samsung  but right now  it is the king of the hill.
the bigger thing is that it is a phone that is likely to remain attractive no matter what gains the competition comes up with.
the first thing one notices is the slender packaging which is now thanks to the removal of the power brick and the earphones.
this was telegraphed by apple months ago with its strategy to remove these  so called  add ons in the name of the environment.
samsung like a spastic kid decided to troll apple only to do the very same thing unapologetically like a megalomaniac.
i don’t like it especially because samsung provided some lovely akg earphones.
but aside from this  you’re looking at a massive phone which samsung has finessed almost perfectly to un do the evils of the hideous monstrosity that the s20 ultra was.
dressed in a slick and stealthy phantom black and a delectable camera bump which seamlessly swoops in the frame of the phone and leaving the seemingly chiselled for posterity  the s21 ultra is a looker.
it also has this supple matte finish which reminds me of the iphone 7 though it comes without the ills of oxidisation as there is gorilla glass victus on the back providing class leading sturdiness and much needed resistance to smudges.
the sides have a polished finish typified by an aluminium frame which makes the phone pretty grippy thanks to the contrast between matte on the back and the polish on the side.
you flip the phone and there is the massive 6.
8 inch dynamic amoled panel which is pretty much the best mobile display on the planet.
it gets obnoxiously bright at 1500 nits  it has sublime colours  it supports hdr formats which make it a delight to netflix and chill on and it has 120hz refresh rate at a quad hd resolution with it having the ability to dynamically ramp down.
this phone is using a new kind of screen which is also 15 per cent more power efficient.
the display is not the only factor which contributes to the impressive battery life of the s21 ultra   the efficiency of the new exynos 2100 chip  the new software optimizations and the impressively massive size  5 000mah  of the battery are important elements as well.
exynos redeems its reputation after the shockingly poor 990 chip in 2020.
the exynos 2100 is beastly thanks to the use of the stock arm cortex x1 based architecture coupled with a new 5nm process which ensures this phone isn t just as fast as max verstappen but also delivers consistent 2 day battery life for even when the device is used extremely.
while you don t get a charging brick  it does support decent charging speeds of 25 watts.
this is admittedly not the best in class but it is at least better than the iphone.
you also get wireless charging at 15 watts and reverse wireless charging which is incredibly handy.
but for most this phone is going to be about raw power and that exynos chip delivers in all kinds of situations be it hectic multitasking or gaming or general fluid navigation of the user interface.
this time around i don t foresee a massive discrepancy in the performance of the phone when compared to phones that are powered by the new qualcomm snapdragon 888 chip.
you also get tons of horsepower in the form of ufs 3.
1 memory  256gb of it when paired in tandem with 12gb of ddr5 ram.
this phone is pretty much the fastest android phone i ve tested and i don t see it losing that mantle overnight with some other phones coming as the processor can hold its own against the qualcomm based competition.
the presence of an integrated 5g modem also makes it future proof if you re the type of person who uses a phone for more than 2 years.
while right now there isn t a 5g network in our country  one can expect that to resolve itself in the next two years where this capability may come in handy.
but for many all of this culminates to one thing   photography.
samsung made a hue and cry about the cameras on the 20 ultra but failed to deliver something that was flagship worthy.
this time like in the design and performance department  it also manages to redeem itself in the imaging department with a truly audacious quad camera system which is the most versatile one seen on a smartphone yet  and is easily the class of the field when one singularly looks at the android crowd in terms of image quality.
it falls behind the new iphones in general reliability  usability and quality but makes up for the variance with the sheer audacity of its functionality and customizable nature.
samsung uses a new generation of its 108 megapixel camera which outputs 12 megapixel photos unless explicitly asked to shoot at its native resolution using the pro mode.
the end results are impressive as it is consistently able to take rich  saturated and detailed photos that are also brightly lit up even in extreme situations.
the night mode is also fabulous as it lights up even the darkest of scenes but at times it gives off an unnatural vibe.
the focusing issues that plagued the s20 are gone as now there is a laser autofocus system to give it a helping hand.
versatility is its forte as it can take gorgeous macros and lush landscape shots using the new ultra wide lens or can even double up as a telescope using its twin 3x and 10x optical zoomed in cameras.
these cameras enable 30x of lossless zoom which looks shockingly good.
in fact  moonshots at even 100x look impressive but other than that  it s a feature that s more of a party trick than something that will be useful daily.
add on features like portrait mode also work impressively well.
a similar trend is repeated on video capture high has been a strong suit of samsung s phones for years.
this time around all four lenses on the back can output 4k video at 60 fps and generally  the quality is tremendous.
that being said  it is still not the iphone 12 level.
audio capture is similarly impressive.
there is also a video booth mode which works quite well and a new birds eye view mode dubbed directors mode helps one use these cameras more effectively.
similarly  the 40 megapixel front facing camera now becomes the best selfie camera in the business.
samsung has fixed everything that i hated about the galaxy s20 ultra and yet retained most things that i ve loved about its phones for almost a decade.
this includes class leading haptics which makes this phone a delight to type on.
superb call quality and reception is a hallmark of this phone while general build quality and the quality of the audio from the stereo speakers is ridiculously good.
it also now supports high resolution audio over usb type c and can output really great sounding music which would be the envy of audiophiles.
the fingerprint scanner is also very accurate and responsive which hadn’t been the case for a couple of years  since samsung decided to use qualcomm’s ultrasonic scanners.
this new generation of the scanner certainly hits the right notes and is bound to be secure  especially when coupled with samsung’s knox enterprise grade security suite.
but all of this comes with some trade offs.
samsung has for instance removed mst technology in samsung pay which makes the service almost useless in india considering the poor penetration of nfc enabled pos machines even in a city like new delhi.
there is no sd card slot so no memory expansion and even like i ve mentioned before  it neither gets a robust facial recognition system nor does it have ultra fast charging technology.
samsung s software    one ui 3.
0 which is based on android 11 is good but not as good as oxygen os or stock android.
it certainly isn t as elegant as ios 14.
it also comes with tons of duplicate apps and will likely not get software updates as fast as some other android phones.
but this is again something typically samsung  as these trade offs come with some benefits as well.

"the reserve bank of india  rbi  will have to give up its powers to regulate government securities  g secs   the debt instruments issued by the central and state governments  sources in the know told business line.
the powers to regulate gsecs will be passed on to sebi.
this is on the back of the budget announcement wherein it has been proposed to merge the securities contracts regulation act  depositories act  and securities exchange board of india act into a new securities code act  sca.
currently  there is a turf war between the sebi and the rbi over regulation of various instruments classified as securities.
rbi to cede control  while regulations of equity cash and derivatives fell under sebi’s purview  several other financial instruments classified as securities were regulated by rbi.
this will now change as the sca takes shape and even sebi’s power and accountability will undergo a major makeover  experts said.
g secs in the form of gpn  promissory notes   bearer bond  stock and bla  bond and ledger account  are issued by rbi  while the agency banks are presently eligible to issue relief/savings bonds in the form of bla only.
the definition of some of these securities may change.
the concept of a unified securities law would help in ease of doing business as there will be a single statutory provision to follow.
it will also unify the g sec market more closely with the equity  currency and derivative market   said sandeep parekh  founder  finsec law advisors.
the fine print of the code will be written now after the fm’s announcement.
in july 2020  sebi chairman ajay tyagi had announced at a public event that issuance of gsecs should follow the stock market model  where companies directly issue shares in the demat account of small investors.
bringing government securities too under a uniform securities code and combining all investment asset classes under a single regulator  i.
e.
sebi  should go a long way in simplifying the regime for investors  both domestic as well as overseas and avoid any regulatory arbitrage to set in   said siddharth shah  partner  khaitan   co.
even when bids are received on a stock exchange platform  the rbi issues securities only in a constituent subsidiary general ledger account  csgl  of a clearing corporation  which in turn credits the securities to the demat account of the retail investors.
all big banks and primary dealers have a sgl account with the rbi at mumbai.
individual traders can open a csgl account with the rbi and get g secs in that account.
csgl is a form of demat account exclusively monitored by the rbi  like the share trading accounts are all monitored by the sebi.
",now  sebi may get to regulate g secs

as a digital company hearing announcement around leveraging digital technologies like video conferencing  e assessments  e invoicing  ai and ml for governance  incentives for digital transaction are heartening.
from the it industry perspective  quite a few relaxations on compliance  laws and also support came from the government during the pandemic.
hope this approach will continue.
– venkatraman narayanan  md   cfo  happiest minds  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   we welcome the increased focus on innovation and on ease of doing business.
this budget appears to have set the right pace for india’s journey to a digital first approach.
from an it services perspective  the industry is facing an intense global competition and needs tax incentives and digital infrastructure support to ensure seamless work from anywhere ecosystem  which is the new normal.
this is a critical requirement for the sector that employs nearly 4.
5 million professionals  contributes 8  of the country’s gdp  has created high quality jobs during the pandemic  and is the face of brand india across the world.
– sanjay jalona  ceo   md  l t infotech  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   at a time of great uncertainty  the first ever paperless union budget 2021 stood out for its unremitting focus on economic recovery through higher spending and inclusive growth opportunities.
the allocation of rs.
50 000 crores over the next five years through the national research foundation to develop india’s potential as a global innovation hub is particularly exciting.
this will undoubtedly provide greater impetus to the indian innovation story.
the budget’s elaborate focus on developing healthcare infrastructure is also very encouraging.
technology will be a key enabler for building a robust healthcare ecosystem that can ensure universal access to high quality and personalized medical resources across the country.
the other thing that stood out in the budget was the major push to revive and drive growth for the msme sector.
doubling the budgetary allocation for this crucial sector  coupled with reducing margin money requirements for startups and promoting ease of business for foreign investors will help this sector develop further.
– prakash mallya  vp md – sales  marketing and communications group  intel india  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   i would like to congratulate the government on its first paperless budget to push india in its digital journey.

allocation of rs.
50 000 crore for the national research fund for next five years is a definite step towards boosting the research ecosystem in a coordinated way.
focus on innovation and r d  coupled with the pli for electronic manufacturing schemes lays down a very strong foundation in building a self reliant digital india.
we are confident that the technology industry will join hands with the government in its plan to enhance manufacturing capabilities and expand r d centres.
supria dhanda  vp and country manager for india  western digital  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   the six pillars of the union budget 2021 add enormous value to the economic relief post the pandemic issues and paint a futuristic picture for the new year.
it has managed to address some of the key issues around atmanirbhar bharat  education and digital india that presents significant business opportunities for global corporates such as lenovo.
with the pli scheme announced along with the increased focus on ‘make in india’ in this budget  we are confident that it will encourage local manufacturing  and further bolster the local pc market.
lenovo will also support the government in enriching india’s economy  by boosting digital infrastructure in the field of education and additional focus on promoting inclusive development.
the national education policy also creates an opportunity to build the indian edtech ecosystem to make it best across the globe for research   innovation  and empowers the citizens to scale up their skills.
– rahul agarwal  ceo   managing director  lenovo india  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   budget 2021 is built on the foundation of new technologies such as data analytics  ai/ml which will empower businesses with econsultation  escrutiny  and compliance management.
this is surely going to enhance enterprise cybersecurity as ai has immense potential to bring in scalable and effective defenses against sophisticated attacks like ransomware.
also  as indian businesses are concerned about their current level of cloud security  there is a need for initiatives that promote the development of cybersecurity skillsets.
additionally  this reskilling process should also take care of security of cloud environments which are the backbone of the accelerated digital transformation that india is witnessing due to the pandemic.
while we welcome the government’s proposed steps in strengthening msmes that provide employment to millions of people  we need more impetus on building skilled cybersecurity professionals in the country.
the government’s allocation of rs.
3 000 crore towards skill development that will help reskill india’s youth and boost the overall economy  is a step in the right direction.
– sunil sharma  managing director – sales  sophos india   saarc  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   the finance minister has presented a balanced budget that is aimed at maximum growth of all sectors in the coming year.

government’s continued emphasis on increasing investment in infrastructure  insurance and digital payments will ensure financial inclusion of the masses.
– vikas garg  chief financial officer at paytm  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   the budget is a major step in the right direction.
it outlays a strong focus on infrastructure  healthcare  capital spending  disinvestment  monetization  job creation and digitization.
these measures are not only progressive and recovery led  if implemented correctly would ease the burden on the economy and lead india towards the projected v shaped growth and development.
the budget talks about structural reforms in banking  enhancing debt financing and credit limits for businesses and asset monetization.
this will lead to an increase in government spending  which  in turn will spur demand  therefore net positive for the industry.
the several initiatives around job creation  startups  reskilling  rural development and better quality of services to people are positive as a nation cannot progress without care for the environment and inclusive all round transformation.
– rajiv bhalla  md  barco india  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   we would have loved to see some more announcements for the bfsi sector over and above the notable mentions like fdi limit being lifted for the insurance sector and the conversation to have happened on the shadow bad bank.
while the stressed assets are being moved to the asset recovery unit  we still have to wait and watch.
it does make sense to take the assets to specialist to monetize it  but it also has the inherent risk of the bank just moving the bad assets rather than works on preventing issue of bad loans or prevents npa’s.
so we have to pay attention to its execution.
and it is also to be seen who is going to be at the helm of the asset recovery to ensure that execution happens in the right way.
there was emphasis on governance issues  and it goes with the turf of independent directors.
so overall largely infra and healthcare  things have not been shaken up much  and attention is paid to economic recovery  but it is yet to be seen if this is a v share or u shape recovery.
let us hope the budget is executed well.

this year  digital india has received special attention with a proposed fintech hub at gift city  digital payments enhancements  and the use of ai and ml in governance.
the government also intends to make tax appellate faceless with tech enablements for identifying tax evaders.
these developments provide a strong foundation for a forward looking data driven economy.
they will surely boost the confidence of technology driven industry players and strengthen the government’s make in india for the world and atmanirbhar bharat vision  besides making the indian tech industry more effective and efficient  thereby establishing new global benchmarks.
– sudeshna datta  co founder   executive vice president  absolutdata  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   the standout proposal in the budget is the absence of a new or additional tax levy.
this is indeed welcome.
however  the goals of disinvestment are very lofty and if these are not met  we will have a huge deficit.
implementation is the key.
the proposals for capital expenditure on infrastructure and rationalization of tax compliances are very welcome.
– dinesh kanabar  ceo  dhruva advisors   india needs significant investments and technology is a key enabler and from that perspective  it could have been much better to invest more in our digital infrastructure.
indian it sector has done reasonably well to not only survive but also helped their customers globally to navigate through the challenging period.
increased investments in health and education can complement it even further.
support to the msme sector can help some emerging providers in it sector.
there is support to innovation and r d which has been considered as one of the pillars for this budget.
investments in national research foundation is an important enabler for the future growth of innovation.
this said  the devil is in the detail and we have to study it deeper to understand it more.
execution is as important as the intent and we will have to wait and watch how some of these get translated into actionable initiatives.
definitely  some of the digital initiatives like digital census and improved digitalization in income tax filing  etc.
may bring some additional indirect benefits for better policy decisions.
this remains a journey and more serious considerations are required for technology sector  – dd mishra  senior research director at gartner  inc.
————————————————————————————————————————————    the budget has announced big ticket projects to add to the digital capabilities with the next general census in the country being the first digital one and along with marque mca 21 project this is likely to garner massive ‘crown jewel’ assets in terms of the sensitivity and quantity of data.
as these projects are rolled out it will increase the importance of security as the government builds the tools and workflows supporting these services.
these projects will need to prioritize solutions such as zero trust access  automated endpoint security  users awareness training to counter a range of threats  and will also need to ensure that solutions such as software defined networking and multi cloud services are implemented securely.
– rajesh maurya  regional vice president  india   saarc  fortinet  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   the union budget 2021 is rightly focused on reviving the country from the aftermath of covid 19 pandemic and ensuring sustainable economic growth.
the announcements of incorporating one man companies with no restriction in paid up capital and turnover  increase in the msme budget to rs 15 700 crore  as well as an update in the definition of small companies under companies act  2013 will also prove to be beneficial for indian msmes and startups.
having said that  given the growth of digital adoption and the role of technology in accelerating digital india and atmanirbhar bharat vision  both businesses and individuals particularly in tier ii and tier iii cities would value greater impetus on digital skilling and improved digital infrastructure to support innovation and the new normal work from home culture  – nikhil arora  vice president and managing director  godaddy india.
————————————————————————————————————————————–   the budget 2021 22 has left the data science community quite excited for what is to come.
for me it was really interesting when the government announced that it will launch multiple data analytics  ai  ml driven models for e security  e education  e  consultation  and compliance management.
also  the prospect of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in gst fraud tracking is quite motivating and intriguing.
the government’s continued support for the startup is quite uplifting as the government is setting aside rs 15 700 crore in fy22 and has reduced margin money requirement from 25  to 15  for startups.
the proposal of extending the tax holiday for start ups by one more year will also give more confidence to the entrepreneurs.
– gaurav shinh  ceo   founder  daas labs  ————————————————————————————————————————————–   the announcement of the national language translation mission is a much needed effort by the government to reach our citizens in the language they understand.
at indus app bazaar  the usage of apps in indian languages on our platform has increased 2.
2 times last year.
we believe that with an enhanced app store ecosystem we will be able to break linguistic barriers and adding more value to the next half a billion indian customers.
moreover  for atma nirbhar bharat to be successful  the focus should be on technology innovation as a whole.
we appreciate the government’s focus on innovation and r d in the budget 2021.

"google amp kya hai   accelerated mobile pages ke fayde nuksan july 18  2017 by guest author friends aaj is post me mai aapko bataunga google ke ek new project ke baare me jisko naam diya gya hai google amp / google  accelerated mobile pages.
google amp kya hai  amp ko kis liiye bnaya gya hai  and google amp use karne ke kya fayde hain or google amp use kaise kare.
agar aap nahi jante ki google accelerated mobile pages kya hai to is post ko padhne ke baad aap achi tarah se samajh jayenge ki google amp kya hai.
table of contents  hide   hide   1 google amp  kya hai    2 google amp work kaise karta hai   1.
amp html 2.
amp js 3.
amp cache  3 google ne amp ko kyu create kiya    4 google amp se seo par kya effect padta hai    5 google amp ke advantages  फायदे   6 google amp ke disadvantages  नुकसान   7  google amp other information conclusion  1 google amp  kya hai   amp google ka ek open source project hai jise publishers/bloggers/website owners ke liye bnaya gya hai.
amp ki help se har koi website owner apni site me mobile optimized contents create kar sakta hai jo ki sabhi devices  phone  tablet  me fast load ho jata hai.
ham sabhi jante hai ki aaj ke time me smartphone ek popular device hai and har koi smartphone ko sabse jyada use me lata hai.
websites me aane vala mostly traffic bhi mobile devices se hi aata hai.
isiliye google ne apna new project amp start kiya because website ka loading time se bhi uske traffic par bahut jyada affect padta hai.
google ka amp project ko start karne ka main goal ye hi hai ki vo apne users ko ek best mobile experience de sake and kisi bhi type ki website har kisi mobile device me bahut ki kam time me load ho jaye taaki users ko site open hone ke liye wait na krna pade.
google amp product manager ke according ek amp coded page ka load time 0.
7 seconds hota hai jabki non amp pages ko open hone me maximum 22 seconds lagte hain jiske karan site ke traffic bahut hi low ho jata hai.
2 google amp work kaise karta hai   google amp ek open source framework hai  basically ye html ka faster version hai jise amp html kaha jata hai.
amp pages ko javascript se optimize  css3 se customize kiya jata hai and sabhi amp pgaes cached hote hai yaniki jab bhi website me amp pages enable hote hai to website ko open karne par site ke sirf main contents hi load hote hai jisse site fast load ho jati hai.
amp page me jitne bhi extra widgets hote hai wo load nahi hote  usse site ki speed bhut fast ho jati hai.
amp ko 3 parts me divided kiya gya hai.
1.
amp html amp html bhi ek html language ki tarah hai but amp html ko customize karke tyaar kiya gya hai.
amp html page me bhi regular html tags add kiye gye hai but kuch html tags ko amp specific tags se replaced  kiya gya hai.
ex.
img  ko  amp img  se replace kiya jata hai  in custom tags ko amp html components ka name diya gya hai.
2.
amp js amp js library ka work amp html pages ko fast render  प्रस्तुत  karne ka hai.
3.
amp cache amp cache ek proxy based delivery network hai jiska work amp pages ko deliver karne ka hota hai.
amp cache amp html pages ko fetch and cache karke pages ki performance ko automatically improve karta hai.
3 google ne amp ko kyu create kiya   google ka amp project ko start karne ka main maksad ye hi hai ki users ko ek fast load speed dena chahte hain because aaj ke time me google ka other search engines se ek serious competition hai and agar google apne users ko search result ke through kisi website ko access karne ke liye ek best speed deta hai to google easily apne market share ko maintain kar sakta hai.
amp create karne ka other reason logon ko mobile web ki taraf attract karna hai.
because google ki khud ki kuch top mobile installed apps hain joki unke market share ka bhi source hai isliye jitne jyada mobile users increase honge utna hi benefit google ko bhi milega.
4 google amp se seo par kya effect padta hai   amp search engine ranking factor nahi hai and agar aap apni website me amp use karte hai to search ranking me aapko kuch jyada fayda nahi hoga because search ranking ko better karne ke liye aapko sabhi factors ko follow karna hoga jo ranking ko increase karne me helpful hote hain.
but agar ham baat kare website ke seo ki to speed matter karti hai because agar aapke site ki loading speed best hai to traffic bhi best hi hoga and aapke site me organic traffic increase hoga.
amp ke faster load ki help se site ka traffic and bounce rate bhi kam hoga.
search engine optimization ke liye website ka responsive/fast loading hona bahut jaroori hai and google amp ka work hi website ko responsive bnane ka and fast load ka hai.
so amp ko use karne se site ke seo par bhi good effect padega.
5 google amp ke advantages  फायदे  google amp mobile users ke liye bahut hi faydemand hai because amp pages enable sites ka load time and performance non amp sites se better hota hai and ham jante hai ki 70  people mobile se hi web surfing karte hain.
agar koi site open/load hone me bahut time leti hai to koi bhi us website ko open karna pasand nahi karta.
amp ki help se user easily website ko surf kar leta hai.
website ki performance and load time better hone se website ka organic traffic increase hota hai joki publishers ke liye ek good income generate karne ka best source hai.
6 google amp ke disadvantages  नुकसान   google amp project ads ko support karta hai it means amp pages me aap ads ko bhi add kar sakte hain but amp ke use se mobile se hone vala revenue limited सिमित   ho jata hai because amp pages only main contents ko hi load karta hai joki ek bahut hi bada disadvantage hai.
amp google analytics ko bhi support karta hai but analytics ko amp me add karne ke liye different tags ki requirement hoti hai jinhe pure amp pages me implement karna hota hai jisme bahut saara time lagta hai.
7  google amp other information google amp project ke baare me kuch aur janne ke liye ampproject.
org google amp demo dekhne ke liye g.
co/ampdemo conclusion google amp abhi new project hai  jisme abhi bhut se problems bhi hai jinko sahi kiya ja raha hai.
.
to aese me agar aapko coding ki sahi janakari nahi hai to aap khus se kuch bhi code edit karke amp implement naa kare.
.
agar aapka blog wordpress par hai to aap amp plugin ko install karke kar sakte hai.
or agar blogger part hai to aap blogger amp template use kare.
mai aapko recommend karunga ki aap apne site ke pages  about us  contact us  par amp ko implement kare esa karne se aapke site ki search engine ranking me improvement hoga.

"the 2021 budget comes as a relief for seniors above 75 years of age.
the centre has exempted them from filing income tax returns if the paying bank deducts the entire dues from pension and interest incomes.
once a 75 plus citizen gives a declaration to her bank  it will compute her income after giving effect to the deduction under chapter vi a and rebate under section 87a of the income tax act for the assessment year and deduct the tax payable.
once this is done  she won’t be required to furnish the income tax return  itr  for the assessment year.
this amendment will take effect from april 1.
sitharaman’s proposal is an extension of several announcements made in the budget 2018  when the government proposed to amend laws for giving tax benefits to senior citizens.
while dishing out her goodies on the direct taxes front  the finance minister offered a sigh of relief to taxpayers by not raising the rates.
she also halved the time limit for income tax proceedings for re opening of assessment to three years from the end of the relevant assessment year.
the most important relief for all businesses would be the reduction in time limit for reopening of assessment to three years for normal cases  and only in case of concealment of income of over rs 50 lakh  it has been retained at 10 years.
this would also go a long way in boosting the investor confidence and ensuring tax certainty   says divakar vijayasarathy  founder and managing partner at dvs advisors llp.
for non resident indians  the government has proposed to remove the element of double taxation to simplify issues arising out of their accrued incomes in their foreign retirement accounts as a result of mismatch in taxation periods.
the budget 2021 also proposes that the advance tax liability on dividend income would arise after declaration or payment of dividend.
while the expectations were rife for a cut in the personal income tax rate and also an increase in the deduction limit under section 80c and 80d to boost consumption  the government decided to provide some relief to nris  senior citizens and also dividend investors this time   says ajit mishra  vp research at religare broking.
to make filling up of income tax returns easier and simpler  the details of capital gains from listed securities  dividend income and interest from banks would come pre filled  while the details of salary income and tax payments would need to be filled up.
other proposals in the direct taxes arena include setting up of the national faceless income tax appellate tribunal centre and introduction of electronic communication between the tribunal and the appellate.

"bloomberg  bloomberg  a mammoth spending plan of almost  500 billion announced by prime minister narendra modi ’s government is expected to jump start growth in an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic  but may not be enough to make a dent in the rising unemployment and poverty india has battled.
finance minister nirmala sitharaman on monday unveiled a national budget that will cause the fiscal deficit to balloon to a much higher than expected 9.
5  in the current year ending march on the added expenditures.
stock market investors cheered the plan  hoping for an economic resurgence and celebrating the absence of new taxes on the wealthy and corporations  while bonds tumbled on worries about the record deficit.
still  the budget didn’t have major proposals to address the job losses  hunger  and rising pressures on the farming and rural sectors.
in fact  the ballooning deficit will force the modi government to curb spending on some rural programs in the coming fiscal year.
modi cut back the budgetary allocation for rural development  which includes a jobs guarantee program  spending for rural roads and pension for widows  by 10  to 1.
95 trillion rupees in the year starting april.
that will help him boost investments in creating assets by 26  and keep the overall spending little changed at nearly 35 trillion rupees   480 billion  from a year ago.
the central intent has been to use expansionary fiscal policy to support growth  sidestepping concerns over debt sustainability and sovereign rating   said abheek barua  chief economist at hdfc bank ltd.
that said  the budget does not adequately address concerns over inequitable growth which has been a worry across the globe due to the pandemic.
india’s budget offers a look at the new challenges emerging nations must now contend with after coronavirus lockdowns upended the lives of daily wage earners worldwide.
unemployment in india reached 9.
1  in december and 85 million people are estimated to have fallen into the ranks of the newly poor  particularly migrant workers who returned to villages.
while the government didn’t make major changes to personal income taxes it also didn’t give much to the middle class and the poor  who were expecting some relief from the budget  barua said.
the government has  stretched its resources to deliver for the most vulnerable sections of our society – the poorest of the poor   sitharaman said in her budget speech.
spending on infrastructure development will again generate employment  she said.
the new proposals also come as the government faces widespread anger from farmers  whose protests against market reforms overwhelmed parts of the capital new delhi last week.
despite that there were no measures announced for them in the government’s plan.
the proposed increase in capital expenditure is coming at the expense of non capital expenditure  keeping aggregate spending the same  amit basole  who teaches at the privately run azim premji university  said.
this shift is desirable in normal times  but in these times  leaves a massive livelihoods crisis unaddressed  he said.
meanwhile  the government sought to bolster the nation’s financial stability  with plans to set up a company to manage a growing pile of bad loans.
the idea has been debated by policy makers for more than three years and is aimed at culling out soured debt off lenders’ balance sheets and creating room for faster lending.
the bad bank will include such soured assets and will be sold on to investors at a reduced price at a time indian lenders are struggling with one of the world’s worst bad loan ratios.
still  the budget offered few further details on how some of these steps would be achieved.
the budget will be followed by the reserve bank of india ’s rate decision friday  with expectations for policy makers to possibly resume interest rate cuts as inflation cools.
the government is fully prepared to support and facilitate the economy’s reset   sitharaman said.
this budget provides every opportunity for our economy to rise and capture the pace it needs for a sustainable growth.
among other spending increases  india said it would hike its health expenditure by a massive 137   attempting to improve an under resourced public system that has struggled to manage the world’s second largest covid 19 outbreak.
the fiscal deficit next year is expected at 6.
8  of gross domestic product  sitharaman said.
that’s wider than the 5.
5  forecast in a bloomberg survey.
the administration will borrow about 12 trillion rupees to meet the shortfall.
sitharaman had pledged before monday that the government would look beyond fiscal deficits in its aim to revive asia’s third largest economy  which is expected to outpace the global recovery.

the federal spending plan is among india’s most highly anticipated and closely watched annual events  and more so this year as modi’s government seeks to recover from the country’s deepest ever recession.
this is not a populist budget  there is no major attempt to redistribute incomes by increasing taxes on high income groups   said prabhat awasthi  managing director and country head of india at nomura holdings inc.

"about 1 500 of the initial volunteers in a late stage clinical trial of the oxford/astrazeneca covid 19 vaccine were given the wrong dose  but weren t informed that a mistake had been made after the blunder was discovered  documents obtained by reuters show.
instead  the dosing mishap was presented to the trial participants in a letter dated june 8 as an opportunity for university of oxford researchers to learn how well the vaccine works at different doses.
the letter was signed by the trial s chief investigator  oxford professor andrew j.
pollard  and sent to the trial subjects.
as reuters reported on dec.
24  participants were given about a half dose due to a measuring mistake by oxford researchers.
the pollard letter didn t acknowledge any error.
nor did it disclose that researchers had reported the issue to british medical regulators  who then told oxford to add another test group to receive the full dose  in line with the trial s original plan.
there is no suggestion there was any risk to the health of trial participants.
much is riding on the british developed vaccine  which is being rolled out across the uk and has been touted as a low cost weapon against the pandemic.
the jab has come under scrutiny because of the dosing error in the oxford trial and a paucity of data about its efficacy in older people who are most vulnerable to the virus.
reuters shared the letter   which it obtained from the university through a freedom of information request   with three different experts in medical ethics.
the ethicists all said it indicates the researchers may not have been transparent with trial participants.
volunteers in clinical trials are supposed to be kept fully informed about any changes.
they are not clear at all about what they need to be clear about   what s going on  what they knew  the rationale for undertaking further research   said arthur l.
caplan  founding head of the division of medical ethics at new york university grossman school of medicine.
it is lost in a snowstorm of verbiage.
steve pritchard  a spokesman for oxford  told reuters   the half dose group was unplanned  but we did know in advance that there was a discrepancy in the dose measurements and discussed this with the regulators before dosing and when the dosing was revised.
pritchard also said   we have not stated that a dosing error occurred.
pollard didn t respond to a request for comment.
the spokesman s suggestion that no error was made is contradicted by documents produced last year by oxford and its vaccine partner  drugs giant astrazeneca plc.
in december  reuters reported that a  global statistical analysis plan  by oxford/astrazeneca  dated nov.
17 and later published in the scientific journal the lancet  called the dosing discrepancy  a potency miscalculation.
a spokesman for astrazeneca declined to comment.
the health research authority  a british government agency responsible for approving medical research and ensuring it is ethical  said in a statement that changes to the study design and the letter sent to participants were approved by one of its ethics committees.
the oxford/astrazeneca vaccine recently has received authorization for use in a growing number of countries  including the united kingdom  the european union and india.
the uk became the first country to approve it  and began rolling out the vaccine on january 4.
but questions surrounding the clinical trials continue to plague the vaccine.
last week  germany s vaccine committee recommended it should only be given to people aged under 65  while the eu  which authorized it on friday for people aged 18 and over  lowered its reported efficacy rate from 70.
4  to 60.
in both cases  authorities cited a lack of sufficient data from the clinical trials.
the eu also has sharply criticized astrazeneca for cutting back its planned vaccine deliveries to the continent over the next few months.
the company has said it is doing its best to boost supplies.
the mistaken half dose   which prompted the letter in june to trial participants   continues to be a factor in the reported efficacy of the oxford/astrazeneca vaccine.
oxford had reported interim results in november that showed the efficacy rate for trial subjects who mistakenly received a half dose and a subsequent full dose booster shot was 90   and that the rate for those who received two full doses was 62.
combining data from the two dosing regimens resulted in an efficacy of 70.
4.
in authorizing the vaccine  uk regulator  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra   accepted the pooled results  but didn t approve administering the half dose/full dose regimen.
there is not persuasive evidence of a real difference in  vaccine efficacy between the two different dosing regimens  it said.
recent changes   the vaccine s late stage clinical trial began on may 28.
within days  oxford researchers realized trial participants had been given lower doses than planned after they displayed milder than expected side effects  such as fever and fatigue.
they alerted british medical regulators.
on june 5  the researchers amended the trial protocol at the request of regulators to add a new group that would receive the correct full dose of the vaccine.
three days later  they alerted trial subjects to what they called  recent changes in the study  in a two page letter attached to an updated 13 page  participant information sheet.
the letter  signed by chief investigator pollard  stated that researchers  are not sure what dose of vaccine is most likely to be protective against covid disease  and explained that doses  are measured using standard scientific test methods.
it said the late stage trial participants received a dose measured using one method and that another group will receive a dose measured using a different test to match the dose given in another clinical trial of the vaccine.
it said the lower dose is  still in the normal range of doses that are used in clinical trials  and  if it can provide protection  it might be better for use in vaccine programmes.
caplan said the explanation would be of  no interest whatsoever to the subject because it s too technical.
to me  that qualifies as gobbledygook.
what you want to know is  why are they doing this  we made an error  it involved dosing  we re not worried about it.
he and other ethicists interviewed by reuters said researchers are obligated to be forthcoming with test subjects when things go wrong.
as a letter purporting to explain a  an error and b  a change of protocol i find this entirely inadequate   said simon woods  a professor of bioethics at newcastle university  in an email.
it reads like a routine update  and a complex one at that.
emma cave  a professor of healthcare law at durham university s law school  said   presenting the dosing variation as a planned change in the study is potentially a breach of trust if in fact the dosing resulted from an error.
the letter makes clear the dosing change but not the reason for the change.

गूगल के नए नियमों के अनुसार  ऐप डेवलपर्स के लिए इन ऐप्स की ख़रीदारी कंपनी के अपने बिलिंग सिस्टम से करना अनिवार्य कर दिया गया है.
इससे भारतीय स्टार्ट अप्स के संस्थापकों में काफ़ी नाराज़गी है जिनका आरोप है कि  गूगल कंपनी अपने प्रभुत्व का दुरुपयोग कर रही है.
कुछ न्यूज़ रिपोर्ट्स में कहा गया है कि  भारतीय स्टार्ट अप्स में उस 30 प्रतिशत कमीशन को लेकर भी चिंता है जो गूगल लेने की बात करता है.
कई भारतीय स्टार्ट एप्स का कहना है कि  जो शुल्क तय किया गया है  वो बहुत अधिक है  और ये लोग गूगल प्ले स्टोर को बाय पास करने यानी उसका एक विकल्प तैयार करने की बात कर रहे हैं.
भारत के एंटी ट्रस्ट नियामक की टिप्पणी से भी भारतीय स्टार्ट अप्स का हौसला बढ़ा है जिसने नवंबर में कहा कि  वो भारतीय बाज़ार में अपनी शक्तियों का दुरुपयोग करने के लिए गूगल की जाँच करेगा.
हालांकि  कंपनी गूगल इन आरोपों को सही नहीं मानती.
कंपनी का कहना है कि वो अग्रणी भारतीय स्टार्ट अप्स के साथ अपनी चिंताओं को साझा करने के लिए तैयार हैं.
इसके लिए कंपनी ने कुछ सत्र आयोजित करने की बात कही है.
एक वैकल्पिक ऐप स्टोर बनाने के बारे में जानकारी फ़िलहाल स्पष्ट नहीं है  मगर पर्याप्त कंपनियाँ इसमें रुचि लेती हैं  तो भारत सरकार इस पर गंभीरता से विचार करना चाहती है.
लेकिन विशेषज्ञों की राय है कि एक वैकल्पिक ऐप स्टोर बनाना आसान नहीं होगा और अगर इसमें सरकार को शामिल किया गया तो इससे भारतीय फ़र्म्स और उपभोक्ताओं  दोनों की परेशानी बढ़ेगी.
राष्ट्रवाद या अवसरवाद   गूगल पर लंबे वक़्त से भारत में छोटे प्रतिद्वंद्वियों की बाँह मरोड़ने का आरोप लगता रहा है.
यह एक ऐसा आरोप है जिससे गूगल हमेशा इनकार करता है.
लेकिन भारतीय स्टार्ट अप्स अब खुलकर कह रहे हैं कि ऐप स्टोर के नियमों को बदलकर गूगल ने भारतीय कंपनियों को एक कोने में धकेल दिया है.
भारत में बिकने वाले अधिकांश स्मार्टफ़ोन गूगल के एंड्रॉय्ड प्लेटफ़ॉर्म पर चलते हैं.
ऐपल भी इसी तरह की कटौती करता है  लेकिन गूगल की तुलना में भारत के स्मार्टफ़ोन बाज़ार में इसकी हिस्सेदारी बहुत कम है.
कुछ 150 उद्यमियों ने गूगल की नई नीति का विरोध करने के लिए एक गठबंधन तैयार किया है.
भारत के सबसे मूल्यवान स्टार्ट अप पेटीएम  ऑनलाइन टिकट बुकिंग सेवा मेक माय ट्रिप और ऑनलाइन मैचमेकिंग सेवा भारत मैट्रिमोनी जैसी कुछ कंपनियाँ इस समूह का हिस्सा हैं.
वैश्विक स्तर पर भी सॉफ़्टवेयर डेवलपर बड़ी टेक कंपनियों द्वारा एकत्र किये जाने वाले उच्च कमीशन के ख़िलाफ़ बोल रहे हैं.
इमेज स्रोत  aaronp/bauer griffin  सितंबर में  म्यूज़िक स्ट्रीमिंग ऐप स्पॉटिफ़ाय  गेमिंग कंपनी एपिक गेम्स और अन्य कंपनियों ने एक नॉन प्रॉफ़िट गठबंधन की शुरुआत की  ताकि ऐपल और गूगल द्वारा बदले गए ऐप स्टोर के नियमों के ख़िलाफ़ आवाज़ उठाई जा सके.
भारत मैट्रिमोनी के संस्थापक मुरुगावल जानकीरमन ने कहा कि  गूगल ने भारतीय इंटरनेट पारिस्थितिकी तंत्र को उपनिवेशित किया है  ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम से लेकर ऐप तक.
और अब हम सब गूगल की दया पर हैं.
शायद गूगल के सबसे कड़े आलोचक विजय शेखर शर्मा हैं जिनकी पेमेंट कंपनी पेटीएम को गूगल पे से कड़ी प्रतिस्पर्धा का सामना करना पड़ रहा है.
दरअसल  गूगल ने गैम्बलिंग पर अपनी नीतियों का उल्लंघन करने के लिए सितंबर में अपने ऐप स्टोर से पेटीएम को अस्थायी रूप से निलंबित कर दिया था.
उन्होंने  द इकोनॉमिक टाइम्स  अख़बार को दिये एक इंटरव्यू में कहा था कि  एक अमेरिकी या विदेशी कंपनी को भारतीय स्टार्ट अप की नियति को नियंत्रित नहीं करना चाहिए.
फ़िटनेस ऐप गोकी के संस्थापक विशाल गोंडल ने भी अपने एक ट्वीट में गूगल की तुलना ब्रिटिश इंडिया कंपनी से की और लिखा कि  बदलाव आ रहा है.
हालांकि  कुछ लोग इसे व्यापक खेल के एक हिस्से का रूप में देखते हैं.
टेक्नोलॉजी पॉलिसी में विशेषज्ञता रखने वाली समाचार वेबसाइट  मीडियानामा के एक टिप्पणीकार और संपादक  निखिल पाहवा कहते हैं   यह सिर्फ़ व्यवसाय है.
उन्होंने कहा कि  भारतीय कंपनियों को अगर यह गूगल के  प्रभुत्व का दुरुपयोग  लग रहा है  तो वो उसे जवाब दे सकती हैं  लेकिन उनकी राष्ट्रवादी बयानबाज़ी में मौक़ा है  अवसरवाद है.
वैकल्पिक ऐप स्टोर का विचार  वैसे भारतीय कंपनियों की इस तरह की भाषा कोई आश्चर्य की बात नहीं है  क्योंकि भारत के प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी ख़ुद स्थानीय व्यवसायों से विदेशी कंपनियों पर अपनी निर्भरता कम करने का आग्रह करते रहे हैं.
चीन के साथ सीमा विवाद के बाद  पीएम मोदी ने इस बात पर और अधिक ज़ोर दिया है.
पीएम मोदी 264 बिलियन डॉलर के बचाव पैकेज की घोषणा कर चुके हैं.
वहीं अक्टूबर में सूचना प्रौद्योगिकी मंत्रालय के साथ अपनी बैठक में शर्मा और भारतीय स्टार्ट अप समूह के अन्य सदस्यों ने गूगल के प्रभुत्व को कम करने के लिए अन्य उपायों के बीच एक वैकल्पिक ऐप स्टोर विकसित करने का आह्वान किया.
बहरहाल  इस पर विशेषज्ञों ने चेतावनी दी है कि सरकार द्वारा समर्थित ऐप स्टोर के विचार में संरक्षणवाद की प्रतिध्वनि है  जो वैश्विक बाज़ारों में भारतीय फ़र्मों को प्रतिस्पर्धी नहीं बनाने जा रही है.
पब्लिक पॉलिसी के एक्सपर्ट प्रणय कोटस्थाने ने कहा   यह ग़ैर भारतीय ऐप्स के सामने बाधाएं खड़ी कर  भारतीय उपभोक्ताओं की पसंद को प्रतिबंधित करेगा.
बंगलुरू स्थित थिंक टैंक  द तक्षशिला इंस्टीट्यूट  में हेड ऑफ़ रिसर्च कोटस्थाने ने कहा   यह घरेलू एकाधिकार की स्थिति भी पैदा कर सकता है.
इमेज स्रोत  anadolu agency  डेटा सुरक्षा का सवाल  एक ऐप स्टोर चलाने के लिए डेटा सिक्योरिटी बहुत महत्वपूर्ण आवश्यकता है.
गूगल ने बीते सालों में अपने यूज़र्स के डेटा को सुरक्षित रखने के लिए लाखों डॉलर का निवेश किया है  जबकि भारत सरकार के पास अभी तक ऐसा कोई भी विशेष क़ानून नहीं है  जो डेटा प्रोटेक्शन सुनिश्चित करता हो.
एक सवाल यह भी है कि यूज़र डेटा की कमान किसके हाथ में होगी और इसका क्या किया जायेगा   पाहवा ने बताया कि  भारत सरकार के पास सिक्योरिटी सुनिश्चित करने के लिए कोई कारगर उपाय नहीं है.
एक ऐसा ऐप स्टोर जिसे सरकार चलाती हो  वो स्टोर अपने यूज़र्स का निजी डेटा सरकार को बड़ी आसानी से दे सकता है.
और सरकार इस डेटा का इस्तेमाल राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा के नाम पर कर सकती है.
भारत के सॉलिसिटर जनरल मुकुल रोहतगी ने 2015 में कहा था कि निजता का अधिकार  संविधान के अंतर्गत मौलिक अधिकारों में नहीं आता है.
इस नज़रिये को सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने दो साल बाद पूर्णत  खारिज कर दिया था.
कोटस्थाने के अनुसार  हमारे पास अपने डेटा को लेकर सरकार पर भरोसा करने की कोई वजह नहीं है.
हमें डेटा प्रोटेक्शन क़ानून चाहिए.
इमेज स्रोत  getty images  डिजिटल इंडिया पर गूगल की पकड़  गूगल पहले ही भारत में बहुत सारी जाँचों का सामना कर रहा है और इसी महीने अमेरिकी सरकार ने भी ग़ैर प्रतिद्वंद्वी निर्णयों के लिए गूगल पर एक केस किया है.
फिर भी भारत सरकार के लिए या फिर स्थानीय स्टार्ट अप्स के लिए गूगल को पीछे छोड़ पाना आसान नहीं होगा जो न सिर्फ़ इस देश के डिजिटल उद्योग पर काफ़ी प्रभाव रखता है और साथ ही साथ अपनी पहुँच लगातार बढ़ा भी रहा है.

"kati outinen chose kai nieminen as suve’s poet  who brings comfort and humor to a difficult time.
actor and the artistic director of kajaani poetry week kati outinen answers the phone with a hands free device from the road on the way from kajaani to helsinki.
he didn’t want to take the risk of bringing a virus variant as a gift from the train when he left the previous week kajaani dance festival to the jury of the event.
that’s why he chose the car.
and now we have to get to helsinki before the promised snowstorm makes driving on icy roads even more awkward.
is outinen’s third year as the artistic director of kajaani poetry week.
only once has he been able to carry out the festival really.
the year 2020 was missed  as with so many other events.
outinen does not  ignite at all for streaming.
the biggest prize in organizing a festival is meeting people.
and when i have the film side of the human being also  as performances streaming means to me a little bit of a bad time of shortages movie.
in the coming summer  however  kajaani poetry week will take place physically  in one form or another.
most of the performances were already planned for last year.
the program will also be kept looser than in previous years in order to take care of safety gaps.
author and translator kai nieminen in the yard of his home.
in pernaja last spring.
­  one year the tradition of the word art event held in 1976 is the selection of suve’s poet.
this year  that poet is kai nieminen  whose work outinen became acquainted with a little coincidence.
after receiving nieminen’s ten year old work i’m starting to learn  outinen immediately fell in love.
nieminen wrote it when he turned 60 years old.
i myself will turn 60 this year.
i wanted to know what anyone who has experienced this milestone thinks about whether anything can be learned in this life.
according to outinen  nieminen  who translated japanese poetry and was interested in zen buddhism  brings comfort and humor in the middle of a difficult time.
the world is changing  but it won’t end  don’t worry   stated together i’m starting to learn collection of poems.
the poems that bring joy and light to nieminen bump in the middle of the corona.
gentle humor is something that makes it quite easy for my heart to swim.
i realized i wanted to offer others this poet who has the ability to see things through humor.
the poetry week’s program includes an actor  among other things eero ojalan presentation between the moon and us  which is ojala ‘s second long monologue from nieminen’ s poems.
outisen the poets of the souvenir suve have so far all been born in the first half of the last century  eeva kilpi in 2019 and tua forsström in 2020.
as forsström did not receive flowers last summer  this year in kajaani we will see  in outinen’s words   two wise people who look at the world with gentle eyes   ie nieminen and forsström.
but last time  when poetry caused outinen cold colors  the word artist was by no means a representative of the large age groups  but born in the late 1990s.
amanda gorman  whose poem draws on the stage poem tradition joe biden at the inauguration showed outinen once again how important art and poetry are.
parents always ask young people how you feel and what you think is important.
in gorman’s poem  it all came to be summed up  how wonderful it was that a young man had followed his time and written down his observations with thought.
author aura nurmi.
­  the new generation of poetry has not been forgotten in kajaani’s repertoire either  aura nurmen the stage poetry workshop has already aroused widespread interest.
poetry is in a strong state of renewal.
new ways of doing poetry are accepted in the canon  and it’s wonderful to have it in kajaani as well.
outinen sees his wash as an  mediator  as an artistic director.
when i see something that touches me  or something i don’t understand  and therefore want to see it a second time  i want to offer that opportunity to others.
last for a reason  outinen did not see much new performances  but something nonetheless  rose and seidi haarlan a new childhood aroused the feelings that outinen wants to share.
especially when there was a lot of talk in the news at the same time about the symptoms and violence of young people.
illuminating a child’s perspective a new childhood also seemed to fit a perfect pair for a parent who already had a job in kajaani hanna vahtikarin like a raging mother for the presentation.
taken aback  i am happy to say that artists have hit the deal with the things that are now rising to the surface in society anyway   outinen says.
the corona pandemic is also visible in the festival program  but only as escapism.
i notice a slight koronakapinaa cultural factors all sides.
after all  it’s weird that beer can be gutted and karaoke can be sung  but kids can’t do it.
i really hope that by the summer the situation will calm down  and in kajaani you can once again enjoy the culture from a safe distance and behind a mask.
with software choices  we want to offer alternative ways to look at the world after a long dark time.
",poetry   kati outinen is in favor of meeting people  and that is why kajaani poetry week is organized as a physical event   streaming resembles a bad movie in times of scarcity

दिल ज्यादा खुश रहता है और बीमार कम होता है  नॉनवेज के मुकाबले वेजिटेरियन डाइट आपको ज्यादा स्वस्थ रखती है  इस पर रिसर्च की मुहर भी लग चुकी है। अमेरिकन जर्नल ऑफ क्लिनिकल न्यूट्रिशन में प्रकाशित रिसर्च कहती है  हृदय रोगों का खतरा घटाना है तो शाकाहारी खाना खाइए।  इंग्लैंड और स्कॉटलैंड में 44 561 लोगों पर हुई रिसर्च हुई। इसमें सामने आया कि नॉन वेजिटेरियन के मुकाबले जो लोग वेजिटेरियन डाइट ले रहे थे उनमें हृदय रोगों के कारण हॉस्पिटल में भर्ती करने की आशंका 32 फीसदी तक कम है। इनमें कोलेस्ट्रॉल का लेवल और ब्लड प्रेशर दोनों ही कम था।  3.
फल सब्जियों की मात्रा बढ़ाते हैं तो कैंसर का खतरा घटता है  अब तक सैकड़ों ऐसी रिसर्च सामने आ चुकी हैं जो कहती हैं  खाने में अगर फल और सब्जियों की मात्रा बढ़ाते हैं तो कैंसर का खतरा कम हो जाता है। ऑक्सफोर्ड यूनिवर्सिटी में हुई रिसर्च के मुताबिक  अगर डाइट से रेड मीट को हटा देते हैं तो कोलोन कैंसर होने का खतरा काफी हद तक घट जाता है।  4.
डायबिटीज कंट्रोल करना है तो 50  तक फल सब्जियां खाएं  वियतनाम के मेडिकल न्यूट्रिशनिस्ट डॉ.
बिस्वरूप चौधरी कहते हैं  अगर ब्लड शुगर कंट्रोल करना चाहते हैं तो दिनभर की डाइट में 50 फीसदी से ज्यादा फल और सब्जियां लें। इसके बाद ही अनाज शामिल करें। नॉनवेज  अंडा  मछली  मक्खन और रिफाइंड फूड लेने से बचें। ऐसा करते हैं तो ब्लड शुगर काफी हद तक कम किया जा सकता है।",protein fund  better than non vegetables  protein  it reduces the risk of death to 24   know how to lack the protein

"new delhi  finance minister nirmala sitharaman on monday announced the much awaited voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and polluting vehicles  and vehicles older than 15 years will be required to undergo fitness tests.
presenting the budget for 2021 22 in parliament  sitharaman said that under voluntary vehicle scrapping policy   personal vehicles would undergo fitness test after 20 years while commercial vehicles would require it after completion of 15 years.
vehicles would undergo fitness tests in automated fitness centres after 20 years in case of personal vehicles  and after 15 years in case of commercial vehicles.
details of the scheme will be separately shared by the ministry   the finance minister said.
this will help in encouraging fuel efficient  environment friendly vehicles  thereby reducing vehicular pollution and oil import bill  she said.
stating that the policy would cover over one crore light  medium and heavy motor vehicles  road transport  highways and msmes minister nitin gadkari said details of the voluntary scrappage policy will be declared within 15 days.
gadkari said the policy will lead to new investments of around rs 10 000 crore and create as many as 50 000 jobs.
the policy would cover an estimated 51 lakh light motor vehicles  lmvs  that are above 20 years of age  while another 34 lakh lmvs are above 15 years.
it would also cover 17 lakh medium and heavy motor vehicles  which are above 15 years  and currently without valid fitness certificates   gadkari said.
these vehicles are estimated to cause 10 12 times more pollution than the latest vehicles  he said.
last month  the government had said it plans to impose green tax on old polluting vehicles soon in a bid protect environment and curb pollution while vehicles like strong hybrids  electric vehicles and those running on alternate fuels like cng  ethanol and lpg will be exempted.
the revenue collected through the green tax will be utilised for tackling pollution.
under the scheme  transport vehicles older than eight years could be charged green tax at the time of renewal of fitness certificate at the rate of 10 to 25 per cent of road tax  as per green tax proposal sent to states for consultations after cleared by the ministry.
outlining the benefits of the scrapping policy  gadkari said it would lead to recycling of waste metal  improved safety  reduction in air pollution  lower oil imports due to greater fuel efficiency of current vehicles  and stimulate investment.
he said india will be a automobile manufacturing hub in next five years.
he said demand for new vehicles will grow and automobile industry will reach rs 6 lakh crore from the present rs 4.
5 lakh crore.
reacting on the announcement  kenichi ayukawa  president  society of indian automobile manufacturers  siam   said   good macroeconomic growth will translate to good auto sector demand.
specifically  the vehicle scrappage scheme has a good intent and the auto industry would be keen to work with the government on suggestions for maximising benefits to environment and society.
rudra pandey  partner  shardul amarchand mangaldas   co termed the policy as a positive step towards supporting the automobile industry  which has been hit hard in the past year due to the impact of covid 19.
the automobile industry had made a vehicle scrapping policy one of their principal demands to enable them to combat this situation.
the policy is proposed to be introduced on a voluntary basis  and the intention is to phase out old and unfit vehicles  both commercial and personal  from indian roads  which will not only result in a reduction in environmental pollution but will also boost the sales of new vehicles  including the production and sale of electric and hybrid vehicles   he said.
pandey said it is likely that the policy will provide for certain financial/ loan based incentives to be provided to customers who choose to scrap their old and polluting vehicles for newer alternatives.
the policy will provide a fillip to the indian government s efforts to position india as a global automobile manufacturing hub  as well as benefit global automakers with manufacturing industries in india  including japanese giants suzuki  toyota  nissan  amongst others   he said.
on july 26  2019  the government proposed amendments to motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles.
we have submitted the proposal and i am expecting that we will get approval as early as possible for the scrapping policy   gadkari had said on january 15.
the minister had also said that once the policy is approved  india will become an automobile hub and there will also be reduction in the prices of automobiles.
he had said recycled material from old vehicles will help reduce the prices  adding that the automobile industry s turnover  which is rs 4.
5 lakh crore with rs 1.
45 lakh crore exports  will get a boost.
in may 2016  the government had floated a draft voluntary vehicle fleet modernisation programme  v vmp  that proposed to take 28 million decade old vehicles off the road.

कांग्रेस के पूर्व अध्यक्ष राहुल गांधी ने सेना में ‘टूर ऑफ ड्यूटी’ प्रस्ताव की आलोचना करते हुए पीएम मोदी पर तंज कसा है। उन्होंने ट्वीट कर कहा   याद कीजिए रडार के बारे में जिन्होंने भारतीय वायुसेना को समझाया था  ‘टूर ऑफ ड्यूटी’ भी उसी दिमाग की उपज है। भारतीय सेना एक लड़ाकू बल है  पर्यटन स्थल नहीं है।   गौरतलब है कि भारतीय सेना ने मई में भर्ती के लिए ‘टूर ऑफ ड्यूटी’ मॉडल का प्रस्ताव रखा था  जो युवाओं को तीन वर्ष के लिए स्वेच्छा से अस्थायी तौर पर सेना में शामिल होने का मौका देगा। इसका उद्देश्य सेना में भर्ती के लिए ज्यादा से ज्यादा युवाओं को आकर्षित करना  अधिकारियों की रिक्तियां भरना और अंतत  रक्षा पेंशन का बोझ घटाना है  जो ‘वन रैंक  वन पेंशन’  ओआरओपी  योजना लागू होने के बाद बढ़कर रक्षा बजट का लगभग 30 प्रतिशत हो गया है। फिलहाल इस प्रस्ताव पर चर्चा हो रही है। वहीं  कुछ जानकारों का कहना है कि यह प्रस्ताव भारतीय सेना के लिए ठीक नहीं रहेगा। राहुल गांधी ने इसी प्रस्ताव के बारे में अपने ट्वीट में बोला।,things   n big news live  in jammu and kashmir s shopies  the encounter between security forces and terrorists
